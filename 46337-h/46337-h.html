        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be well to
        state briefly the object and plan of the present work. Some years ago
        their Lordships the Archbishops and Bishops of Ireland decided to
        lengthen considerably the course of Sacred Scripture read in this
        College. As a result of their decision, all our students are now
        expected to read the whole of the New Testament with the exception of
        the Apocalypse, together with portions of the Old Testament. This
        change, while it has the desirable advantage of familiarizing our
        students with a larger portion of the Sacred Text, obviously renders
        it impossible that so much time as formerly should be devoted to the
        study of any one portion. The consequence of this is that it is now
        impossible for any but the very ablest students to find time to read
        the longer commentaries, such as those of Maldonatus, Estius, and A
        Lapide. I was not long, therefore, in charge of the Class of Sacred
        Scripture, when I became convinced that it would be useful, if not
        necessary, to provide the students with a more compendious exposition
        of the portions of Scripture that they are expected to study.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this object
        in view, I have not attempted, in the present work, to give an
        exhaustive commentary on the Fourth Gospel. Such an attempt, indeed,
        would have frustrated my object. I have tried rather, while omitting
        nothing of importance, to introduce nothing unnecessary, and to
        observe throughout the utmost consistent brevity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I am prepared to
        hear that some will consider I have passed too lightly over the
        easier portions of the Gospel. I can only say, in reply, that what I
        have done, has been done deliberately. Where the meaning of God's
        word is sufficiently clear, I consider that it ought to be left to
        the exercise of the student's intelligence to find it, and I am
        strongly of opinion that in such cases a commentator may well be
        excused from interposing his remarks between the reader and the
        Sacred Text.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It might seem that
        the able and learned commentary of Dr. MacEvilly—the only Catholic
        commentary hitherto existing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageiv">[pg
        iv]</span><a name="Pgiv" id="Pgiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> on
        this Gospel in the English language—would render such a work as the
        present unnecessary. But the length of His Grace's work, like the
        works of Maldonatus, Estius, and A Lapide, renders it not wholly
        adapted to the present conditions of our students. Besides, anyone
        acquainted with the work of a professor will readily realize how
        important it is, and how desirable, when possible, that students
        should possess in handy and permanent form the professor's views. No
        two men will think alike on all the difficult and intricate questions
        arising out of the Gospel of St. John; and while I should feel it my
        duty, if lecturing on the work of another, to impose upon the
        students of my class the necessity of taking notes, I have hope that
        the present work will to a large extent obviate such a necessity. His
        Grace's work will, no doubt, continue to be used by many of our
        students in preference to mine, and with all of them it will still
        hold its place as a useful book of reference.</p>

          Gospel.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That St. John
          the Apostle is also an Evangelist, and author of the fourth Gospel,
          has been the all but unanimous testimony of tradition. If we except
          the Alogi (St. Epiph., <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Haer.</span></span>, li. 3, 4), heretics of
          the second century, who denied the Johannine authorship, not on
          historical, but on dogmatic grounds, the authenticity of the Gospel
          was unquestioned down to the end of the eighteenth century. Since
          that time, however, it has been frequently and variously attacked
          by the so-called Rationalists, whose many views in regard to it may
          be reduced to one or other of the three following theories:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. The patrons
          of what is sometimes called the <span class="tei tei-q">“partition
          theory”</span> hold that, though the work as a whole cannot be said
          to be St. John's, still considerable portions of it are his. About
          the extent of these portions they differ. Weisse, who, in the year
          1838, first gave prominence to this theory, held that the
          discourses attributed to Christ in the Gospel are studies from the
          pen of St. John, representing what he considered to be the doctrine
          of Christ; and that St. John's disciples afterwards set these
          discourses in their present historical framework, and thus produced
          the Gospel. Others, however, admit that some portions of the
          narrative, as well as the discourses, are the work of St. John.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. The Gospel is
          in no part the work of St. John; still the historical portions
          contain valuable traditions derived from that Apostle. Renan,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name=
          "Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> who holds this view,
          says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The fourth Gospel is not the work of
          the Apostle John. It was attributed to him by one of his disciples,
          about the year 100. The discourses are almost wholly fictitious;
          but the narrative portions contain valuable traditions, which reach
          back in part to the Apostle John.”</span><a id="noteref_1" name=
          "noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. This, like
          the preceding theory, denies the Johannine authorship; but it goes
          farther than the preceding, in denying to our Gospel any historical
          value. According to this theory, not only are the discourses
          spurious, but the historical portions are wholly unreliable, and
          the Gospel was forged in the latter half of the second century. So
          Baur and many others.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Against these
          various adversaries there is abundant evidence, external and
          internal, in favour of the authenticity of our Gospel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Apostolic
            Fathers</span></span> do not, indeed, quote our Gospel as the
            work of St. John, for it was not their custom to name the author
            from whom they quoted; but passages are met with in the works of
            these fathers which are very probably founded upon passages in
            our Gospel. Compare, for instance, with John xxi. 20, the words
            of St. Clement of Rome († 101):—<span class="tei tei-q">“John
            also, who leaned upon the bosom of our Lord, whom the Lord loved
            exceedingly”</span> (Epis. 1 <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
            Virgin</span></span>, c. 6); or with John iii. 8, the words of
            St. Ignatius of Antioch († 107):—<span class="tei tei-q">“The
            Spirit, since He is born of God, is not deceived, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">for He knoweth
            whence He cometh and whither He goeth</span></span>”</span> (Ad.
            Philad. 7). It would be easy to multiply instances of this
            kind;<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href=
            "#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> but,
            as such coincidences are always more or less inconclusive, it is
            more important to note here that Papias and Polycarp, two
            disciples of St. John, indirectly support the claim of the fourth
            Gospel to authenticity. For it is certain that both these writers
            accepted the First Epistle of St. John as his.<a id="noteref_4"
            name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> Now,
            so great is the similarity of style between our Gospel and that
            Epistle, and so close the relation between the two, that we are
            justified in concluding, with Cornely (Introd. iii. 59, 3), that
            Papias and Polycarp, admitting the one, probably admitted also
            the other to be the work of St. John. Even Renan admits that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The two writings offer the most complete
            identity of style, the same terms, the same favourite
            expressions.”</span> Indeed we have now the direct testimony of
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name=
            "Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Papias in a
            fragment of his rather recently discovered: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Quant au silence de Papias il n'est plus possible

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Fathers

            with our Gospel, and some of them refer to it as the work of St.
            John. Thus, when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-weight: 700">Justin Martyr</span></span> († 167), in
            proving the necessity of Baptism (<span class=

            i. 61), says: <span class="tei tei-q">“For Christ said:
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘Unless you be born again, you shall not
            enter into the kingdom of heaven.’</span> Now that those born
            once cannot enter again into the wombs of their mothers, is clear

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-weight: 700">Irenæus</span></span> († 202), who was Bishop

            between 180 and 190 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            "tei tei-q">“Afterwards John, a disciple of the Lord, who
            reclined upon His breast, also wrote a Gospel.”</span> This
            testimony of Irenæus is of very special importance; for, besides
            being a native of Asia Minor, and a bishop in Gaul, and thus
            representing in himself the traditions of both countries, he was
            moreover a disciple of Polycarp, who was himself a disciple of
            St. John, so that no one had better opportunities than Irenæus of
            learning everything connected with the Apostle.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Indeed, so
            well was our Gospel known, and its authority recognised in the
            second century, that even the heretics of the time sought the
            sanction of its authority for their errors. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“They use that which is according to John,”</span>
            says Irenæus, speaking of the Valentinian heretics of the second

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. We abstain
            from quoting Fathers of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-weight: 700">third century</span></span>, because it is not
            denied that they knew our Gospel, and acknowledged St. John to be
            the author. Even Strauss (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Leben Jesu</span></span>, § 10, p. 47) says:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“It is certain that towards the end of
            the second century, the same four Gospels which we have still,
            are found recognised in the Church, and are repeatedly quoted as
            the writings of the Apostles, and disciples of the Apostles,
            whose names they bear, by the three most eminent ecclesiastical
            teachers—Irenæus, in Gaul; Clement, in Alexandria; and
            Tertullian, in Carthage.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is
            undeniable then that before the close of the second century, the
            fourth Gospel was everywhere in the Church received as the
            genuine work of St. John. This, we hold, proves that it must be
            indeed his work. For he lived on till the end of the first
            century; his disciples till the middle, and their disciples till
            the end, of the second century. Is it possible then that a
            spurious work, produced by some forger in the second century,
            could have been everywhere so soon received and recognised as the
            work of the Apostle?</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. The author
            himself tells us (xxi. 20, 24), that he is <span class=

            His breast at supper.”</span> Now according to all the fathers,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the disciple whom Jesus loved,”</span>
            &amp;c., was St. John. Moreover, the three most favoured
            disciples were Peter, James, and John. They alone were permitted
            to be present at the raising to life of the daughter of Jairus
            (Mark v. 37), at the transfiguration (Matt. xvii. 1), and at the
            agony in the garden (Matt. xxvi. 37). But Peter cannot be the
            writer of our Gospel, from whom he is explicitly distinguished
            (John xxi. 20); nor James the Greater, for, in the opinion of
            all, he had been beheaded by Herod Agrippa I. (Acts xii. 2) many
            years before our Gospel was written. It remains then that the
            writer must be St. John. Nor does this argument lose its force,
            even though we admit that the last two verses of our Gospel (John
            xxi. 24, 25) were not written by St. John. For since they have
            stood in the Gospel from the beginning, they must at least be the
            evidence of a contemporary; so that we have here either an
            internal argument or another powerful external one in favour of
            the Johannine authorship.</p><a name="Intro_I_B_2" id=
            "Intro_I_B_2" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. While the
            Apostle John plays an important part in the other Gospels, he is
            not named even once in the fourth Gospel. If we had only it, we
            should not know that there was an Apostle of that name. The fair
            inference then is, that he himself being the writer, suppressed
            his own name through modesty. Moreover, while the other
            Evangelists are accustomed, when they speak of John the Baptist,
            to distinguish <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg
            005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            him from John the Apostle, our author, again through modesty,
            ignores the Apostle, and refers nineteen different times to the
            Baptist as John without any distinguishing appellative.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. The style
            is just such as we should expect from St. John; the Greek purer
            than that of the other Gospels, because of the author's long
            sojourn in Asia Minor, yet not untinged by Hebraisms because of
            his earlier life spent in Palestine.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. The whole
            Gospel points to its author as one who was intimately acquainted
            with Palestine and its customs, and who had lived and moved among
            the events he describes.<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> Thus
            the journey from Cana to Capharnaum is rightly described as a
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">descent</span></em> (John iv. 47, 51); the
            author is acquainted with the pools of Bethsaida and Siloe at
            Jerusalem (John v. 2, ix. 7), with the position of the brook of
            Cedron in relation to Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives (John
            xviii. 1), and with the distance of Bethany from the Holy City
            (xi. 18).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among Jewish
            customs he refers to the manner of purification before meals
            (John ii. 6), and to their avoidance of intercourse with
            Samaritans (iv. 9), and hints at the objection of their teachers
            to speak publicly with women (John iv. 27). He shows, too, that
            he is familiar, not merely with Jewish festivals, but also with
            their peculiar solemnities (John vii. 2, 37), and the time of
            their occurrence (x. 22). Finally, he declares himself an
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">eye-witness</span></em>, as well where he
            says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The Word was made flesh, and dwelt
            among us, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">and we saw His glory</span></span>”</span>
            (John i. 14), as where he tells us, <span class="tei tei-q">“He
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that
            saw it</span></em>, hath given testimony ... and he knoweth that
            he saith true”</span> (John xix. 35).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. John,
          Apostle, Evangelist, prophet, and martyr, was born in Galilee, the
          son of Zebedee, a fisherman of some means, and Salome, one of those
          holy women who ministered to our Lord during His public life, and
          stood by His cross on Calvary (Mark i. 20; Matt. iv. 21, xxvii. 56;
          Mark xv. 40, xvi. 1). Before his call by Jesus, John was probably a
          disciple of the Baptist, and it is extremely likely that he was one
          of the two who at the preaching of their Master first believed in
          Christ (John i. 37, and foll.). Called with his brother James,
          immediately after Peter and Andrew (Matt. iv. 18, 19, 21),
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name=
          "Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> he left all things
          to follow Christ, and became the best beloved of all the disciples.
          With Peter and his own brother James he was permitted to witness
          the raising to life of the daughter of Jairus, and to be present at
          the transfiguration on Thabor, and the agony in Gethsemane (Mark v.
          27; Matt. xvii. 1; Matt. xxvi. 37). He was privileged to recline on
          his Master's bosom at the Last Supper (John xviii. 23), and to him
          alone was given from the cross the blessed trust of providing for
          the Mother of God (John xix. 27). Nor did he fail to return love
          for love. When the Apostles fled in terror from Gethsemane (Mark
          xiv. 50), Peter and John followed Jesus into the court of the
          High-priest (John xviii. 15); and at the last tragic scene on
          Calvary, our Evangelist, brave with the courage begotten of love,
          was still close to his Master (John xix. 26).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the
          descent of the Holy Ghost, St. John, with St. Peter, took a leading
          part in establishing the Church. He and Peter were the first to
          suffer imprisonment for preaching the faith of Christ (Acts iv. 2,
          3); and, again in company with Peter, he was chosen to go down from
          Jerusalem, and confer the Sacrament of Confirmation on the
          converted Samaritans. How long he remained in Palestine, we cannot
          say with certainty. When St. Paul went up to the Council of
          Jerusalem, in 47 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>,<a id="noteref_7"
          name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> he
          found St. John there; but whether our Apostle had himself gone up
          specially to the Council, or had hitherto confined his preaching to
          Palestine, it seems impossible to say, for St. Peter was there too,
          though he had been already Bishop of Antioch, and was then Bishop
          of Rome.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In addition to
          the preceding facts gleaned from the New Testament, we learn from
          tradition that the saint remained in Jerusalem till after the
          Blessed Virgin's death (Niceph., <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">H. E.</span></span>,
          ii. 42); that he subsequently preached in Asia Minor, and, probably
          after the martyrdom of St. Paul (67 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>), settled at Ephesus
          (Origen, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">H. E.</span></span>,
          iii. 1). In the reign of Domitian (81-96 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>) he was taken to
          Rome, and thrown into a cauldron of boiling oil, from which he came
          forth unhurt (Tertull., <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          then banished to the island of Patmos, in the Aegean Sea, where he
          wrote the Apocalypse; was liberated on the accession of Nerva
          (96-98 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>), and allowed to
          return to Ephesus, where he lived to an extreme old age, and died
          in the sixty-eighth year after our Lord's Passion (Jer.,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The object or

          Jesus was the Son of God made man, and that all supernatural life
          must come to us through faith in His name. Hence he tells us in the
          very beginning that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Word was God ...
          and the Word was made flesh, and dwelt amongst us”</span> (John i.
          14); and in xx. 31: <span class="tei tei-q">“But these are written
          that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, and
          that believing you may have life in His name.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. To supplement
          the three Synoptic Gospels. So nearly all the fathers. And, indeed,
          it is perfectly evident that an Evangelist who is entirely silent
          regarding the birth, infancy, and childhood of our Lord, and who
          introduces Him abruptly to the reader at the beginning of His
          public life, cannot have meant to write a complete life of Christ.
          And since St. John wrote many years after the other Evangelists, it
          is not surprising to find that his work partakes more of a
          supplemental character than any of the Synoptic Gospels.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What has just
          been said regarding the object of the Gospel will enable us to form
          a general conception of its plan. It must be carefully borne in
          mind that St. John did not intend to write a Life of Christ, nor to
          give a general view of His teaching, nor to compile a work on the
          general history of his own times. His main object was to prove that
          Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God; and the various parts
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name=
          "Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the Gospel are
          carefully disposed with a view to this end. Out of the vast mass of
          materials at his disposal (xxi. 25; xx. 30) he selects such
          incidents, such miracles and discourses of our Lord, as are best
          suited to the attainment of this special purpose. In accordance
          with this view, we subjoin a brief outline of the <em class=

          Writing.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The exact date
          of our Gospel is uncertain. One thing is absolutely certain: that
          it was written after the other three Gospels. Some have placed it
          almost as early as 70 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>; but the weight of
          evidence, external and internal, places it in the last decade of
          the first century, that is to say, between 90 and 100 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is great
          doubt, too, as to the place where it was written. Irenæus
          distinctly states that it was written at Ephesus,<a id="noteref_11"

          many of the fathers are of the same opinion. On the other hand, a
          large number of ancient writers hold, that, like the Apocalypse, it
          was written in Patmos. See Patrizzi, lib. i., cap. iv., § 86, who
          himself inclines to the latter view.</p>

          Gospel.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. John's
          Gospel has this peculiarity, that it is made up, in great part, of
          Christ's discourses. Judging from the attention which the
          Evangelist seems to pay to the order of time, we feel sure that
          these discourses are reported in the chronological order in which
          they were delivered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But are they
          reported in the very words used by Christ? We feel convinced that
          they are not. The important heads of doctrine, such as iii. 3, 5,
          bearing on baptism; or vi. 48, 52, regarding the Blessed Eucharist,
          are, doubtless, reported in almost<a id="noteref_12" name=
          "noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> the
          exact words of our Lord. But the discourses generally we believe to
          be reported merely in substance. For this was sufficient for the
          Evangelist's purpose; and, therefore, we have no reason to suppose
          a miraculous assistance which would enable him to remember every
          word. No doubt the Evangelist had the assistance of inspiration;
          but the Catholic view of inspiration warrants us in believing that
          in general the ideas only, and not the words, were inspired. We
          thus get rid of the Rationalist difficulty that the discourses must
          be fictitious, because, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg
          010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          they say, no human memory could retain such long discourses for
          more than half a century. For in our view it is only the substance
          of the discourses that is handed down, and, even if we abstracted
          altogether from the assistance given him by inspiration, it is not
          difficult to believe that the young and retentive mind of a loving
          disciple would treasure up and retain the substance of his Divine
          Master's discourses, aided as it must have been by the fact that
          these discourses, besides being the food of his daily meditation,
          were doubtless again and again repeated in his apostolic
          preaching.</p>

          which had already arisen in the time of the Evangelist, and against
          which, therefore, his Gospel was immediately directed. What these
          were we learn from SS. Irenæus and Jerome. The former distinctly
          says that our Gospel was directed against the errors of
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">In the
        beginning.</span></span> These words most probably mean here, as in
        Gen. i. 1, at the beginning of all created things; in other words,
        when time began. Their meaning must always be determined from the
        context. Thus we know from the context in Acts xi. 15, that St. Peter
        there uses them in reference to the beginning of the Gospel.
        Similarly, the context here determines the reference to be to the
        beginning of creation; for He who is here said to have been in the
        beginning, is declared in verse 3 to be the creator of all things,
        and must therefore have already been in existence at their
        beginning.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others, however,
        have interpreted the words differently. Many of the fathers
        understood them to mean: in the Father, and took this first clause of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014"
        id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> v. 1, as a declaration that
        the Word was in the Father. But, though it is quite true to say that
        the Word was and is in the Father (x. 38), both being consubstantial,
        still such does not seem to be the sense of the phrase before us. Had
        St. John meant to state this, surely he would have written: In God,
        or, in the Father, was the Word. He names God in the next two
        clauses: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">And the Word was with God, and the Word was
        God</span></span>. Why then should he at the risk of being
        misunderstood, refer to Him in this first clause under another name?
        Besides, if this first clause stated the Word's consubstantiality
        with the Father, the third clause: <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">And the Word was
        God</span></span>, would then be tautological.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many of the
        commentators also urge against this view, that if the first clause
        meant, in God (or, in the Father) was the Word, the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em>
        clause would be merely a repetition. But we cannot assent to this,
        since, as we shall see, the second clause would add the important
        statement of the Word's distinct personality. However, the view seems
        to us improbable for the other reasons already stated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others take
        <span class="tei tei-q">“beginning”</span> here to mean eternity, so
        that we should have in this first clause a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">direct</span></em>
        statement of the Word's eternity. But against this is the fact that
        ἀρχη (beginning) nowhere else bears this meaning, and can be
        satisfactorily explained in a different sense here. Hence, as already
        explained, <span class="tei tei-q">“in the beginning”</span> means:
        when time began.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, was <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">already</span></em>
        in existence. Had St. John meant to declare that at the dawn of
        creation the Word began to exist, he would have used ἐγένετο as he
        does in verse 3 regarding the beginning of the world, and again in
        verse 6 regarding the coming of the Baptist. This cannot fail to be
        clear to anyone who contrasts verses 1, 2, 4, and 9 of this chapter
        with verses 3, 6, and 14. In the former ἦν is used throughout in
        reference to the eternal existence of the Word;<a id="noteref_17"
        name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> in the
        latter ἐγένετο, when there is question of the beginning of created
        things (3), or of the coming of the Baptist (6), or of the assumption
        by the Word of human nature at the incarnation (14). At the beginning
        of creation, then, the Word was already in existence; and hence it
        follows that He must be uncreated, and therefore eternal. St. John's
        statement here that the Word was already in existence in the
        beginning, is, accordingly, equivalent to our Lord's claim
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015"
        id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to have existed <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before</span></em>
        the world was (xvii. 5), and in both instances the Word's eternity,
        though not directly stated, follows immediately. Hence we find that
        the Council of Nice and the fathers generally inferred, against the
        Arians, the eternity of the Son of God from this first clause of
        verse 1. <span class="tei tei-q">“If He was in the beginning,”</span>
        says St. Basil (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">De Div.</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hom.</span></span> xvi.

        Person. That he speaks of no mere abstraction, or attribute of God,

        in either Old or New Testament of this use of the term λόγος.
        Throughout the rest of the Scriptures its usual meaning is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">speech</span></em> or
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">word</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What, then, we may
        ask, led our Evangelist, in the beginning of his Gospel, to apply
        this term rather than Son, or Son of God, to the Second Divine
        Person? Why did he not say: In the beginning was the Son?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Apart from
        inspiration, which, of course, may have extended to the suggestion of
        an important word like the present, apart also from the
        appropriateness of the term, of which we shall speak in a moment, it
        seems very probable that St. John was impelled to use the term λόγος
        because it had been already used by the heretics of the time in the
        expression of their errors.<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href=
        "#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> Endowed,
        too, as St. John was, like the other Apostles, with a special power
        of understanding the Sacred Scriptures (Luke xxiv. 46), and
        privileged as he had been on many an occasion to listen to the
        commentaries of Christ Himself on the Old Testament, he may have been
        able, where we are not, to see clearly in the Old Testament instances
        in which λόγος refers to the Son of God; <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Verbo (τῷ λόγῳ) Domini coeli firmati
        sunt”</span> (Psalm xxxii. 6).</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One thing, at all
        events, is quite plain, that, whatever may be said regarding his
        reason for the application of this <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">term</span></em> to
        the Son of God, St. John did not borrow his <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">doctrine</span></em>
        regarding the λόγος from Plato or Philo or the Alexandrian School.
        For though the term (λόγος) is frequently met with in the writings of
        both Plato and Philo, yet Plato never speaks of it as a person, but
        only as an attribute of God; and Philo, though in our opinion, he
        held the distinct personality of the Word, yet denied that he was
        God, or the creator of matter, which latter Philo held to be eternal.
        As to the Alexandrian School, to which Philo belonged, and of whose
        doctrines he is the earliest witness, there is not a shadow of
        foundation for saying that any of its doctors held the same doctrine
        as St. John regarding the Divine Word.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the teaching
        of Christ, then, or by inspiration, or in both ways, our Evangelist
        received the sublime doctrine regarding the λόγος with which his
        Gospel opens.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having now
        inquired into the origin of the term λόγος as applied to the Son of
        God, and having learned the source whence St. John derived his
        doctrine regarding this Divine Word, let us try to understand how it
        is that the Son of God could be appropriately referred to as
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the
        Word</span></span> (ὁ λόγος). Many answers have been given, but we
        will confine ourselves to the one that seems to us most
        satisfactory.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We believe, and
        profess in the Athanasian Creed (Filius a Patre solo est non factus,
        nec creatus, sed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">genitus</span></em>), that the Son is begotten
        by the Father; and it is the common teaching that He is begotten
        through the Divine intellect. Now, this mysterious procession of the
        Son from the Father through the intellect, is implied here in His
        being called the Word. For, as our word follows, without passion or
        carnal feeling, from our thought, as it is the reflex of our thought,
        from which it detracts nothing, and which it faithfully represents;
        so, only in an infinitely more perfect way, the Son of God proceeded,
        without passion or any carnal imperfection, through the intellect of
        the Father, detracting nothing from Him who begot Him, being the
        image of the Father, <span class="tei tei-q">“the figure of His
        substance.”</span> (Heb. i. 3.) <span class="tei tei-q">“Verbum
        proprie dictum,”</span> says St. Thomas, <span class="tei tei-q">“in
        Divinis personaliter accipitur, et est proprium nomen personae filii,
        significat enim quamdam emanationem intellectus. Persona autem quae
        procedit in Divinis secundum emanationem intellectus, dicitur filius,
        et hujusmodi processio dicitur generatio”</span> (St. Thom., 1 Qu.
        34, a. 2 c.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">And the Word was with

        refers not to the Divine Nature, but to the Divine Person of the
        Father (see 1 John i. 2); otherwise the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Verbum</span></em>
        would be unnecessarily and absurdly said here to be with Himself,
        since He is the Divine Nature terminated in the Second Person. Many
        commentators are of opinion that the use of πρός (with), and not ἐν
        (in), proves that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Verbum</span></em> is not a mere attribute of
        the Father, but a distinct Person. So Chrys., Cyril, Theophy., A
        Lap., Patrizzi, M'Evilly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">And the Word was
        God.</span></span> As our English version indicates, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Word</span></span> is the
        subject of this clause, God the predicate, for in the Greek λόγος has
        the article, Θεός wants it; and besides, as appears from the whole
        context, St. John is declaring what the Word is, not what God is. A
        desire to begin this clause with the last word of the clause
        preceding—a favourite construction with St. John (see verses 4 and
        5)—may have led to the inversion in the original. Or the inversion
        may have been intended to throw the Divinity of the Word into greater
        prominence by placing the predicate before the verb.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some, like Corluy,
        refer <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">God</span></span>, in this third clause, to the
        Divine Nature, which is common to the three Divine Persons; others,
        as Patrizzi, to the Divine Nature as terminated in the Second Divine
        Person. We prefer the latter view, but in either interpretation we
        have in this clause a declaration of the Divinity of the Word, a
        proof that cannot be gainsaid of His essential unity with the Father.
        Nor does the absence of the Greek article before <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“God”</span> in this third clause, when taken in
        conjunction with its presence in the second, imply, as the Arians
        held, that the Word is inferior to the Father. For our Evangelist
        certainly refers sometimes to the supreme Deity without using the
        article (i. 6, 12, 18); and the absence of the article is
        sufficiently accounted for in the present case by the fact that Θεός
        is a predicate standing before the copula.<a id="noteref_21" name=

        verse 1: namely, the Word's eternity, His distinct personality, and
        essential unity with the Father, they are repeated in verse 2. The
        same, that is, this Word who is God, was in the beginning, and was
        with God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Various attempts
        have been made by the Unitarians to escape the invincible argument
        for a Second Divine Person which these opening verses of our Gospel
        contain. Thus, they put a full stop after the last <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“erat”</span> of verse 1; and, taking the words in the
        order in which they occur in the Greek and Latin, make the sense of
        the third clause: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">And God was.</span></span> Then they join
        <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">verbum</span></span>,”</span> the last word of
        verse 1, with verse 2: This Word was in the beginning with God. But
        even if we granted to the Unitarians this punctuation of the verses,
        the sense of the third clause would still be that the Word was God,
        and not that God existed. For <span class="tei tei-q">“Deus”</span>
        (Θεός without the article), in the beginning of the third clause
        ought still to be regarded as the predicate, with <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“verbum”</span> of the preceding clauses as the subject.
        This follows not merely from the absence of the Greek article already
        alluded to, but also from the absurdity of the Unitarian view, which
        supposes that St. John thought it necessary, after telling us that
        the Word was with God, to tell us that God existed!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others have tried
        to explain away the text thus: At the beginning of the Christian
        dispensation the Word existed, and the Word was most intimately
        united to God by love. But, primum, they have still to explain how
        this Word is declared Creator in verses 3 and 10; secundum, the
        statement in verse 14: <span class="tei tei-q">“And the Word was made
        flesh,”</span> implies transition of the Word to a state different
        from that in which He existed <span class="tei tei-q">“in the
        beginning;”</span> but the time of the transition is just the
        commencement of the Christian dispensation, which cannot, therefore,
        be the time referred to in verse 1 as <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        beginning.”</span></p><a name="I_3" id="I_3" class=

        (πάντα = τὰ πάντα, 1 Cor. viii. 6, Col. i. 16). The passages

        were fashioned by Him from pre-existing matter. The Cerinthian
        theory, that the world was made by an inferior being, is here
        rejected. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">By
        Him</span></span> (δι᾽ αὐτοῦ). We are not to suppose that the Word
        was an instrument in the hands of the Father, or inferior to the
        Father, as the Arians held. The preposition διά (per) is often used
        in reference to a principal efficient cause. Thus, St. Paul says of
        the Father: God is faithful, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">by whom</span></em> (δι᾽ οὗ) you are called unto
        the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord (1 Cor. i. 9. See
        also 1 Cor. i. 1, 2 Cor. i. 1, Gal. iv. 27, Heb. ii. 10.) And since
        our Evangelist has just declared in verse 1 the Word's divinity, and
        knew Him to be one with the Father (x. 30), it cannot be implied here
        that the Word is inferior to the Father. Some commentators hold that
        there is no special significance in the use here of the preposition
        διά, while others see in it an allusion to the fact that the Son
        proceeds from the Father, and derives from Him His creative power.
        According to these, creation is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">from</span></em> the Father, but <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em>
        the Son, because the Son has received His creative power, together
        with His essence, from the Father and is not, therefore, like the
        Father, <span class="tei tei-q">“principium sine
        principio.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others think that
        since all things were created according to the Divine idea,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, according to the Divine and
        eternal wisdom, and since the Word is that wisdom, therefore all
        things are rightly said to have been created through the Word. So St.
        Thomas on this verse:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Sic ergo Deus nihil
        facit nisi per conceptum sui intellectus, qui est sapientia ab
        aeterno concepta, scilicet Dei Verbum, et Dei Filius; et ideo
        impossibile est quod aliquid faciat nisi per Filium.”</span> In this
        view, which seems to us the most probable, though like all the Divine
        works that are <span class="tei tei-q">“ad extra,”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> do not terminate in God
        Himself, creation is common to the Three Divine Persons, yet, for the
        reason indicated, it is rightly said to be through the Son.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">And without him was made
        nothing</span></span> (οὐδὲ ἕν = not anything, emphatic for οὐδέν
        nothing) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">that
        was made</span></span> (Gr.: hath been made). By a Hebrew parallelism
        the same truth is repeated negatively: all things were made by Him,
        and nothing was made without Him. To this negative statement,
        however, there is added, according to the method of pointing the
        passage common at present, an additional clause which gives us the
        meaning: nothing was made without Him, of all the things that have
        been made. This restrictive clause may then <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> be understood to imply that, together with the
        Word, there was something else uncreated, that is to say (besides the
        Father, whose uncreated existence would be admitted by all) the Holy
        Ghost also.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this way after
        the Macedonian heresy arose in the middle of the fourth century, and
        blasphemously held that the Word had made the Holy Ghost, because
        without Him was made nothing, many of the Fathers replied: Nothing
        was made without the Word, of the things that were made; but the Holy
        Ghost was not made at all, and is therefore not included among the
        things made by the Word. However, this restriction is not necessary
        to defend the Divinity of the Holy Ghost. Even though we understand
        it to be stated absolutely that nothing was made without the Son, no
        difficulty can follow; for the Holy Ghost was not <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">made</span></em>
        (ἐγένετο), but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">was</span></em> (ἦν) from all eternity, as is
        clearly implied elsewhere. John xvi. 13, 14.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On dogmatic
        grounds, therefore, there is no necessity for connecting:
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quod factum
        est</span></span>, in the end of verse 3, with the preceding. And, as
        a matter of fact, all the writers of the first three centuries seem
        to have connected these words with verse 4,<a id="noteref_22" name=
        "noteref_22" href="#note_22"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> and it
        appears to us very likely, that it was because of the Macedonian
        heresy they began to be connected with verse 3. St. Chrysostom
        certainly is very strong in connecting them with verse 3, but the
        reason is because the heretics of the time were abusing the other
        connection to support their errors. <span class="tei tei-q">“For
        neither will we,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“put a full
        stop after that <span class="tei tei-q">‘nothing,’</span> as the
        heretics do”</span> (Chrysostom on John, Hom. v). We must not,
        however, conclude, from this remark of St. Chrysostom that it was the
        heretics alone who did so; for, as we have said already, such was the
        ordinary way of connecting the clauses during the first three
        centuries; and it is supported not only by the Fathers, but by the
        oldest Latin MSS., and by some of the oldest Greek MSS. And even
        after the Macedonian heretics had abused this passage to blaspheme
        the Holy Ghost, the old pointing, or to speak more correctly the old
        method of connecting the clauses, remained the more common.<a id=
        "noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> Not only
        did Cyril of Alexandria, and Augustine, and Venerable Bede, and St.
        Thomas, and a host of others read in this way, but Maldonatus, who
        himself prefers the connection in our English version: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Without Him was made nothing that was made,”</span>
        admits that the usage of his time was <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> against him, and that it was then the practice
        to put a full stop after <span class="tei tei-q">“nothing”</span>:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Without Him was made nothing.”</span> Nor
        can the Sixtine or Clementine edition of the Vulgate be appealed to
        in favour of our present pointing. As a matter of fact, the Sixtine
        edition <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">rejected</span></em> it, printing thus:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Et sine ipso factum est nihil: quod factum
        est in ipso vita erat;”</span> while the Clementine Bible left the
        matter undecided by printing thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“Et sine
        ipso factum est nihil, quod factum est, in ipso vita erat,”</span>
        &amp;c. We cannot, therefore, understand to what Roman Bibles A
        Lapide refers when he says that the Bibles corrected at Rome connect
        thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“And without Him was made nothing that
        was made.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We think it
        extremely probable, then, that the words: Quod factum est
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that was
        made</span></span>, or, as we shall render in our interpretation;
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">what was
        made</span></span>), standing at present in the end of verse 3, are
        to be connected with verse 4. Some may be inclined to blame us for
        departing from what is at present the received connection of the
        words in such a well-known passage as this. Let us, therefore, sum up
        briefly the evidence that has forced us, we may say reluctantly, to
        connect the words with verse 4.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. Though
        Maldonatus tries to throw doubt upon the fact, this is the connection
        adopted by practically all, if not all, the Fathers and other writers
        of the first three centuries, and by the majority of writers
        afterwards down to the sixteenth century.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. It is supported
        by the oldest MSS. of the Vulgate, and, what is more remarkable, by
        some of the oldest Greek MSS., notwithstanding the fact that St.
        Chrysostom was against it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. The parallelism
        in the verse is better brought out: <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">All things were made by
        Him, and without Him was made nothing.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. If <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quod factum
        est</span></span> were intended to be connected with the preceding,
        the clause would be certainly unnecessary, and apparently useless,
        because it is plain without it that the Evangelist is speaking of
        what was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">made</span></em>, and not including any
        uncreated Being, like the Father or the Holy Ghost.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We prefer, then,
        to connect: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Quod factum est</span></span>, with what
        follows. But it still remains for us to inquire in what way precisely
        the connection is to be made, for various views have been held upon
        the subject.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">A.</span></span> Some
        connect thus: What was made in (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> by) Him, was life, and the
        life was the light of men. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">B.</span></span> Others thus: What was made was
        life in Him, and the life was the light of men. <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">C.</span></span> Others
        again, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name=
        "Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> adopting the same
        punctuation as in the preceding, but understanding differently: What
        was made in it was the Life, and the Life was the Light of men.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last seems to
        us the correct view. For <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">A</span></span> is improbable, inasmuch as it
        either declares all things to have life, or implies that though what
        was made by the Word had life, yet there were other things wanting
        life, which proceeded, as the Manichaeans held, from the evil
        principle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor can we accept
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">B</span></span>, even as explained by St.
        Augustine in the sense that all created things are in the mind of
        God, as the house before building is in the mind of the architect;
        and that being in the mind of God they are God Himself, and
        <span class="tei tei-q">“life in Him.”</span> For though this is in a
        certain sense true, yet it seems to us unnatural to suppose that St.
        John here, in this sublime exordium, thinks it necessary or useful to
        tell us that the archetypes of created things lived in the Divine
        Mind. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">C</span></span> then appears to us to be the more
        probable view regarding the passage: <span class="tei tei-q">“What
        was made, in it was the Life;”</span> or, more plainly: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In that which was made was the Life;”</span> for here,
        as elsewhere, St. John begins with the relative (see <a href="#I_45"
        class="tei tei-ref">i. 45</a>, 1 John i. 1); so that, in this view,
        the Evangelist after telling us the relations of the Word to all
        things at their beginning: <span class="tei tei-q">“All things were
        made by Him, and without Him was made nothing,”</span> now goes on to
        point out His relations to them after their creation: first, His
        relations with things generally: <span class="tei tei-q">“In that
        which was made was the Life,”</span> then his relations with man in
        the supernatural order: <span class="tei tei-q">“And the Life was the
        Light of men.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">5. Adopting this
        view as to the connection between verses 3 and 4, St. Cyril of
        Alexandria thus explains: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Life (ἡ ζωή),
        that is to say, the Only-begotten Son of God, was in all things that
        were made. For He, being by nature life itself, imparts being, and
        life, and motion to the things that are ... In all things that were
        made was the Life, that is, the Word which was in the beginning. The
        Word, being essential life, was mingling Himself by participation
        with all existing things.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If it be objected
        to this interpretation that the first ζωή of verse 4, not having the
        article, cannot mean the Eternal Life, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the
        Divine Word, we reply that St. Cyril, one of the greatest of the
        Greek Fathers, thought differently; and moreover, that very many of
        the commentators who are against us in the interpretation of this
        passage, are yet with us in referring ζωή here to the uncreated life
        of the Divine Word.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if we follow
        what is at present the common punctuation, and read: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In Him was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg
        023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        life,”</span> this is commonly interpreted to mean that the Word is
        the source of supernatural life to man. S. Amb., S. Ath., Tol.,
        Mald., A Lap., Patr., Beel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this view is
        not without difficulty. For, first, if it be merely meant that life
        comes to man through the Word, we might rather expect that the
        preposition διά of the preceding verse would have been retained.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Secondly, if there
        be question here of the Word as the life of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">man</span></em>, how
        is it that it is only in the next clause that man is first mentioned?
        Surely, if the opinion we are considering were correct, we should
        rather expect St. John to have written: <span class="tei tei-q">“In
        Him was the life of man, and the life was the light.”</span> For
        these reasons, and because of what we have stated already in favour
        of connecting <span class="tei tei-q">“Quod factum est”</span> with
        what follows, we prefer to understand this passage, with St. Cyril,
        as a statement that the Word, the Essential Life, was present in all
        things, conserving them in existence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">And the Life was the
        Light of men.</span></span> In our view the meaning is that the Word,
        the Life, who conserved all things in existence, was, moreover, in
        the case of men, their Light—the source and author of their faith.
        Hence, we suppose St. John, after referring to the creation of all
        things, in verse 3, and the conservation of all things, in the
        beginning of verse 4, to pass on now in the end of verse 4 to speak
        of that new creation that is effected in man by means of a spiritual
        illumination: <span class="tei tei-q">“All things were made by (or
        through) Him, and without Him was made nothing. In that which was
        made was the Life, and the Life was the Light of men.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those who
        interpret the beginning of the verse to mean that the spiritual life
        of man comes through the Word, take the present clause as explaining
        how that was so, how the Word was the Life; namely, inasmuch as He
        was the Light. He was the source of our life of grace here and glory
        hereafter, inasmuch as He was the source of our light, that is to
        say, our faith. And some of them, as Patrizzi, hold that the order of
        the terms in this clause is inverted, and that we should read:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the light of men was the life,”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“light of men”</span> being the subject.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Maldonatus tells
        us that almost all writers before his time understood <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“light of men”</span> in reference to the light of
        reason. However, this view is now generally abandoned, and rightly,
        for that man owed his reason to the Word has been already implied in
        verse 3: <span class="tei tei-q">“All things were made by
        Him.”</span> Besides, the <span class="tei tei-q">“light”</span> of
        this fourth verse is doubtless the same as that of verse 5, which
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">men did not
        receive</span></span>, and of verse 7, to <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> which the Baptist was to bear witness. But in
        neither of the latter verses can there be question of the light of
        reason; hence, neither is there in verse 4. The meaning, then, is
        that He who was the preserver of all things was moreover the source
        of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">spiritual</span></em> light of men.</p><a name=

        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">And the light
        shineth.</span></span> The meaning is, that the Word, as the source
        and author of faith, was always, as far as in Him lay, enlightening
        men. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">Shineth</span></span>—the present tense is used,
        though the latter part of the verse shows that the past also is
        meant: <span class="tei tei-q">“The light shineth in the darkness,
        and the darkness <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">did not</span></em> comprehend it.”</span>
        Probably the Evangelist avoids using the past tense, lest it might be
        inferred that the Word had ceased to shine. Besides, the present is
        more appropriate, seeing that, in the sense explained, the Word
        shines <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">throughout all time</span></em>. From the
        beginning the Word shone, as far as in Him lay. If men generally were
        not enlightened, it was their own fault. But all who were saved from
        the beginning, were saved through faith, and no one ever received the
        gift of faith except in view of the merits of the Word Incarnate.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Nulli unquam contigit vita nisi per lucem
        fidei, nulli lux fidei nisi intuitu Christi”</span> (St. August.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The
        darkness</span></span> is man shrouded in unbelief. See Luke i. 79,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        have just said, the meaning is, that unbelieving men refused to be
        enlightened. Ordinarily, indeed, light cannot shine in darkness
        without dispelling it; but in this case the darkness was man, a free
        agent, capable of rejecting the light of faith through which the
        Eternal Word was shining. In telling us that men refused to be
        enlightened, the Evangelist is stating what was the general rule, to
        which at all times there were noble exceptions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">6. The correct
        rendering of the Greek text is: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">There came</span></span> (ἐγένετο) <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">a man, sent by God, whose
        name was John</span></span>. This reference to the Baptist in the
        middle of this sublime exordium is <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> surprising, and has been variously accounted
        for. Some think that our Evangelist, after having treated of the
        Divinity of the Word, merely wishes, before going on to speak of the
        incarnation, to refer to the precursor. But it seems most probable
        that the Evangelist wished to remove at once the error of those who,
        impressed by the austerity and sanctity of the Baptist's life, had
        looked upon him as the Messias. If any of them still remained at the
        time when St. John wrote, or should arise afterwards, they are here
        told that the Baptist, though having his mission from Heaven, was
        only a man intended to bear witness to Christ. Thus the superior
        excellence of Christ is thrown into relief from the fact that a great
        saint like the Baptist was specially sent by Heaven to be His herald.
        The reference in this verse is to the Baptist's coming into the
        world, at his conception, rather than to the beginning of his
        preaching, for at the moment of his conception, he came, sent by God
        to be the herald of Christ. See Luke i. 13-17.</p>

        Jehochanan = Jehovah hath had mercy. This name was appointed for the

        too was a light, nay, as Christ Himself testified <span class=

        "font-weight: 700">which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this
        world</span></span>. The Greek of this verse may be construed and
        translated in three different ways:—1. By connecting ἦν with
        ἐρχόμενον: The true light, which enlighteneth every man, was coming
        into this world. 2. By taking ἐρχόμενον as a nominative agreeing with
        φῶς: There was the true light which <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">at its
        coming</span></span> into the world, enlighteneth every man (iii.
        19.) 3. By connecting ἐρχόμενον with ἄνθρωπον, as in the Vulgate and
        our English version. This is far the most probable view. In favour of
        it we have all the Latin Fathers, all the Greek Fathers except one,
        and all the ancient versions. Besides, ἐρχόμενον is thus connected
        with the nearest substantive with which it agrees in form. Add to
        this that the second opinion, the more probable of the other two,
        would seem to signify that the Word was not a light to all men before
        His coming, but only at His coming; and this, as we have explained
        above on verse 5, is false. The meaning, then, is that the Word was
        the true, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the perfect light, and as far
        as in Him lies enlighteneth at all times every man that cometh into
        this world, be he Jew or Gentile. <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">That cometh into this
        world</span></span>, is in our view a Hebrew form of expression
        equivalent to: that is born. It is used only here in the New
        Testament, but <span class="tei tei-q">“to be born”</span> was
        commonly expressed by Jewish Rabbins by בוא בעולס (to come into the
        world).</p>

        is proved by the masculine pronoun αὐτόν towards the end of the
        verse. It is disputed to what presence of the Word in the world there
        is reference here. Almost all the Fathers understood the reference to
        be to the presence of the Word in the world before the incarnation.
        According to this view, which is held also by A Lapide, the Word was
        in the world, in the universe, conserving what He had created,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“sustaining all things by the word of His
        power”</span> (Heb. i. 3). God is everywhere present by His essence,
        by His knowledge, and by His power; but it is of the latter presence,
        which could be known, that the view we are considering understands
        this clause.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Maldonatus, though
        he admits that the Fathers are against him, holds that the reference
        is to the mortal life of the Word Incarnate. He argues from the fact
        that the world is blamed, in the next clause, for not having known
        the Word; but knowledge of the Word was impossible <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> before the incarnation. It was possible
        indeed to know there was a God, but impossible to know the Second
        Divine Person, the Word. Whatever may be thought of the probability
        of this second view, the arguments ordinarily adduced against it,
        from the use of the imperfect <span class="tei tei-q">“erat”</span>
        (ἦν) and from the alleged fact that all the preceding verses refer to
        the Word before His incarnation, have no weight. For the imperfect
        may be used not in reference to Christ's existence before His
        incarnation, but to show that He not merely appeared among men, but
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">continued</span></em> to dwell for a time among
        them; and the statement that everything before this verse refers to
        the Word before His incarnation, cannot be sustained. For the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Light”</span> to which the Baptist came to
        bear witness (v. 7) was not the Word before His incarnation, but the
        Word Incarnate, as is evident. According to this second opinion,
        verse 11: He came unto His own, and His own received Him not, merely
        emphasizes the ingratitude of the world towards the incarnate Word by
        showing that He was rejected even by His own chosen people.</p>

        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">And the world was made by
        him, and the world knew him not.</span></span> Those who interpret
        the first clause of this verse of the existence of the Word in the
        world before the incarnation, understand the world to be blamed, in
        the remainder of the verse, for its ignorance of its Creator. The
        world is not blamed, they say, for not knowing the Word as the Second
        Divine Person, for such knowledge it could not have gathered from the
        works of creation, but for not knowing God (Rom. i. 20), who is one
        in nature with the Word.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those who
        interpret the first part of the verse of the presence of Christ on
        earth during His mortal life, hold that in the remainder the world is
        blamed for not recognising the Word Incarnate as the Son of God, and
        Second Divine Person. The meaning of the whole verse then, in this
        view, is: that though the Son of God, who created the world, deigned
        to live among men, yet they refused to recognise Him as God.</p>

        preceding verse, that some take this to be the first reference to the
        presence on earth of the Word Incarnate; while others regard it as

        circumstance that even <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        Word in the apparitions of the Old Testament. But all the Fathers
        understood the verse of the coming of the Word as man, and the verses

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">12. There were
        some, however, who believed in Him, or, according to the Hebraism, in
        His name, and to these, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">whether Jews or Gentiles</span></em>, He gave
        power to become adopted children of God. That is to say, after they
        had co-operated with His grace and believed, He mercifully gave them
        further grace whereby they could be justified, and thus be God's
        adopted children. The last words of this verse: <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">To them that believe in
        His name</span></span>, explain what is meant in the beginning of the
        verse by receiving Him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">13. Some
        commentators have found great difficulty in this verse, because they
        supposed that those who in the preceding verse are said to have got
        the power to become children of God are here said to have been
        already born of God. But the difficulty vanishes, it seems to us, if
        verse 13 be taken as explaining not what those who believed were
        before they became sons of God, but the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature of the
        filiation</span></em>, to which those who believed got power to raise
        themselves. It is not faith that makes them sons of God, but through
        faith (not as a meritorious cause, but as a condition) they attained
        to charity, which made them <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg
        029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        children of God. This too is all that is meant in 1 Jn. v. 1. It is
        not meant that by believing they are <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">eo
        ipso</span></span>, through faith alone, sons of God. Faith, as the
        Council of Trent lays down, is the root of justification, but it is
        not the formal nor even the meritorious cause of justification; it is
        a condition <span class="tei tei-q">“sine qua non.”</span> And just
        as St. Paul attributes justification to faith without meaning that it
        is of itself sufficient, so St. John (1 John v. 1) attributes to
        faith Divine sonship without meaning that it comes from faith alone.
        See Decrees of the Council of Trent, Sess. vi. Chap. vi. and viii.
        The meaning of the two verses, according to this view, is, that as
        many as received Christ by believing in Him, got power to become
        children of God, children who <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">were</span></em> born (ἐγεννήθησαν) not of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. Thus verse
        13 explains that these sons of God were born not in a carnal but in a
        spiritual manner. <span class="tei tei-q">“Tria hic de generatione
        humana sic exponit St. Thomas: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        Many think, with St. Chrysostom and St. Cyril, that the Greek verb

        The Greek verb signifies to behold with attention. We beheld not
        merely His human nature present among us, but we beheld His glory as
        in the transfiguration, Matt. xvii. 1, and ascension, Acts i. 9, 11.

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Christ is said to
        have been full of grace and truth, not merely in Himself, but also,
        as the following verses prove, in reference to men with whom He
        freely shared them. Kuinoel, followed by Patrizzi, understands by
        <span class="tei tei-q">“grace and truth”</span> true grace or true
        benefits. But it is more natural to take grace and truth as two
        distinct things, seeing that they are again mentioned separately (ἡ
        χάρις καὶ ἡ ἀλήθεια) in verse 17. Grace may be understood in its
        widest sense; for not only had Christ the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“gratia unionis,”</span> as it is called, whereby His
        humanity was hypostatically united to the Divinity; but, moreover,
        His human soul was replenished to its utmost capacity with created
        grace, which not only sanctified Him, but was also through Him a
        source of sanctification to us. See St. Thomas, p. 2, sec. 7, 8.
        Christ is said to be <span class="tei tei-q">“full of truth,”</span>
        not only because <span class="tei tei-q">“all the treasures of wisdom
        and knowledge are hidden in Him”</span> (Col. ii. 3), but also
        because, as verse 17 states, He gave us the knowledge of the true
        faith and true way of salvation.</p><a name="I_15" id="I_15" class=

        the more perfect grace of the New Law, instead of that given under
        the Old Law (Chrysostom, Cyril, Patrizzi); or (4), and best, by a

        confirms what is stated in verse 16, and at the same time takes
        occasion to prefer Christ to Moses, as he has already preferred Him
        to the Baptist. Moses was but the medium of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">communicating</span></em> to the Jews the Mosaic
        Law, which only pointed out man's duty, without enabling him to

        and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        all the graces whereby we are to merit heaven, and of the perfect
        knowledge of the true faith. This is, doubtless, directed against
        some of the Judaizers, who held that sanctification through the
        Mosaic Law was at all times possible, even after the Christian
        religion was established.</p><a name="I_18" id="I_18" class=

        considerable difference of opinion as to the drift or bearing of this
        verse. Some think that a reason is given why only Christ could give
        the truth, because only He saw God in His essence. Others, that a
        reason is given why the gifts of Christ mentioned in the preceding
        verse, are superior to the Law given <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> by Moses, namely, because Moses never saw God
        in His essence. Others, that the evangelist explains how he and his
        fellow-Apostles received of Christ's fulness, not only through what
        Christ did (17), but through what He taught (18); and the necessity
        for such a Divine teacher is shown by the fact that no one but He
        ever saw God. So St. Thomas.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others, as
        Maldonatus and Patrizzi, hold that the Evangelist is here adding to
        his own testimony, and that of the Baptist, the testimony of our Lord
        Himself, in favour of all that he has said regarding our Lord in this
        sublime prologue; the meaning being: What I have said regarding the
        eternity, personality, and Divinity of the Word, regarding His power
        as creator and regenerator, and regarding His incarnation, I have
        neither seen with my own eyes, nor learned from anyone who saw, for
        <span class="tei tei-q">“no man hath seen God at any time,”</span>
        but Jesus Christ Himself explained these things to me.</p>

        true of every creature, man or angel; if of seeing God in His essence
        without comprehending Him, it is true of all while they are here
        below. The latter is the sense here, for the Evangelist wishes to
        signify that he could not have learned from any mere mortal the
        foregoing doctrine. The saints in heaven see God in His essence, for
        as our Evangelist tells us in his First Epistle: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We shall see Him as He is”</span> (1 John iii. 2. See
        also <a href="#XVII_3" class="tei tei-ref">John xvii. 3</a>).</p>

        only-begotten Son,”</span> the reading: <span class="tei tei-q">“God
        only-begotten”</span> is found in very many ancient authorities, and
        is almost equally probable. Were it certain, it would be an
        additional proof of Christ's Divinity. Christ is the only-begotten
        Son of God, because while He is the natural Son of God, all others
        are but adopted sons.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">23. The Baptist
        with striking humility replies that he is merely a voice, a passing
        sign—yet that voice spoken of by Isaias, which was to call upon men
        to prepare their hearts to receive Christ. The Hebrew of Isaias may
        be rendered: <span class="tei tei-q">“The voice of one that crieth in
        the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the Lord (Jehovah), make
        straight in the desert a highway for our God.”</span> Or, as is more
        probable from the Hebrew parallelism: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
        voice of one that crieth: Prepare ye in the wilderness the way of the
        Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.”</span> The
        Baptist, in applying to himself this prophetic passage, which is also
        applied to him by the three Synoptic Evangelists (Matt. iii. 3; Mark
        i. 3; Luke iii. 4), gives merely the substance of the original. It is
        disputed whether Isaias refers in the literal sense to preparing the
        roads by which the people should return from the Babylonian
        Captivity, and only in the mystical sense to the preparation for the
        Messias, or directly and literally to the preparation for the
        Messias. The latter seems the more probable view. At any rate, the
        words as applied here mean that the Baptist is the voice to which
        Isaias referred (in some sense literal or mystical), and that the
        burden of his cry in the desert of Judea is, that men who heard him
        in the desert should prepare their hearts for Christ.</p>

        xxxvi. 25, and Zach. xiii. 1, that in the time of the Messias there

        that only the Messias, or some of those that were to accompany Him,
        could confer this baptism; and, not understanding the import of the
        Baptist's answer, verse 23, in which he really declared himself the
        herald of Christ's coming, they ask why he presumes to baptize.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">26. The Baptist
        answers that his is not the baptism foretold by the Prophets, which
        was to cleanse the sinner, but as he had declared at the beginning of
        his preaching, a baptism unto penance (Matt. iii. 21). John's baptism
        consisted in an ablution of the body, accompanied by the profession
        of a penitential spirit, preparatory to the coming of Him who was to
        baptize with the Holy Ghost and fire (Matt. iii. 11). It could in no
        sense be said to remit sin; while the baptism of Christ really remits
        sin (Acts ii. 38). Hence the Council of Trent defined:—<span class=

        the perfect of this verb having a present signification. Many
        authorities indeed read the later present στήκει. The meaning is not
        that our Lord was then actually present in the crowd, else St. John
        would probably have pointed him out, as he did on the following day
        (v. 29); but that He was already present among the Jewish people, was
        already living among them.</p>

        Origen, though admitting that nearly all the MSS. of his time read
        Bethania, changed it, on topographical grounds, for Bethabara, in his
        edition of our Gospel. Bethania, according to some, means the house
        of a ship (בית אניה), while Bethabara means the house of a ferry-boat

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">29. On the day
        after that on which the Baptist bore the preceding testimony, he saw
        Jesus coming towards him. This is the first time that the mention of
        the Holy Name occurs in our Gospel. <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Jesus</span></span> (Gr.
        Ἰησοῦς) is the same as the Hebrew ישׂוע, which is itself a
        contraction for יהושׂוע, meaning God the Saviour. That our Lord was
        so called, to show that He was to be the Saviour of men, is clear
        from the words of the angel to St. Joseph: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call His
        name <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        shall <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">save</span></span> His people from their
        sins”</span> (Matt. i. 21). We cannot be certain whence Jesus was now
        coming; but it seems very probable that He was coming from the desert
        after His forty days' fast. We know from <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> St. Mark (i. 12) that as soon as He was
        baptized, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">immediately</span></em> the spirit drove Him out
        into the desert, and He was in the desert forty days and forty
        nights.”</span> Since, then, the present occasion was subsequent to
        His baptism, as we learn from a comparison of verse 33 with St.
        Matthew iii. 16 (for the Baptist alludes, on the present occasion, to
        what took place at the baptism), it follows that it must have been at
        least forty days subsequent. Christ seems too to have been absent
        when, on the day before this, the Baptist bore witness to Him, else
        the Baptist would have probably pointed Him out as present, just as
        he does on this occasion. All things considered, then, it is likely
        Jesus is now returning, and that the Baptist here takes the first
        opportunity of again commending Him to the people.</p>

        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Behold the
        lamb</span></span> (ὁ ἀμνός) of God. The Baptist, in these words,
        points out Jesus as the Messias, for there is evident allusion to
        Isaias liii. 7-12, where the Messias is compared to a lamb before his
        shearers, bearing the sins of many. In referring to Jesus as a lamb,
        the Baptist recalled this prophecy, insinuated Christ's innocence,
        and perhaps suggested that he was to be sacrificed. <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Lamb of
        God</span></span>, because offered by God for the sins of men, as we
        speak of the sacrifice of Abraham, meaning the sacrifice offered by
        him; or it may mean simply the Divine Lamb. But the first opinion
        seems more probable.</p>

        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Who taketh away the sin
        of the world.</span></span> Every word is emphatic. Christ not merely
        covers up, or abstains from imputing sin, but He takes it away
        altogether, as far as in Him lies. And it is not merely legal
        impurities that the sacrifice of this Divine Lamb will remove, but
        sin; and not merely the sin of one race, like the Jewish, but the sin
        of the whole world. <span class="tei tei-q">“Sin,”</span> in the
        singular number, designates as one collective whole every sin of

        known what his father, Zachary, had declared, <span class=

        ejus”</span> (Luke i. 76), that he himself was to herald the public

        His private life; and John, reared in the hill country of Juda (Luke
        i. 39), spent the years before his public mission—perhaps from his
        very childhood (as Origen, Mald.) in the deserts (Luke i. 80), it is
        conceivable how he might not have known Christ's appearance.

        divinely moved to recognise Christ (Luke i. 41, 44); so, immediately
        before the baptism of the latter, he was enabled to recognise Him
        (Matt. iii. 14).</p>

        true son of Jacob. See Gen. xxv. 27; Rom. ix. 6. Jacob's name was
        changed into Israel, after he wrestled with the angel, Gen. xxxii.

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">47-49. Nathanael
        must have felt convinced that he had been hidden from Christ's
        natural view, otherwise he could not draw the inference which, aided
        by divine grace, he draws. Whether Nathanael yet recognised Jesus to
        be true God, and professed his belief in Him as such, in the words of
        verse 49, is disputed. If we are to judge from his words (ὁ υἱός),
        the affirmative opinion seems much more probable. The words are an
        echo of the Baptist's testimony (v. 34), but Nathanael confesses not
        alone Christ's Divine origin, but also His human sovereignty: Thou
        art the Son of God, Thou art the King of Israel.</p>

        This term, probably derived in its Messianic sense from Dan. vii. 13,
        14, was very rarely applied to Christ, except by Himself, and we find
        Him using it very frequently (though not exclusively; see,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, Matt. ix. 6; xxiii. 30; Acts
        vii. 56) in connection with His privations, sufferings, and death
        (Matt. viii. 20; xii.40; xvii. 12; xxvi. 21-25; John iii. 14,
        &amp;c.). It indicates that Christ was not only man like Adam; but
        that, unlike him, He was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">descended</span></em> of man, and therefore our
        brother in the truest sense.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">You shall
        see.</span></span> Though Nathanael is addressed (and He saith to
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">him</span></em>), yet the plural (videbitis)
        shows that the wondrous sign here promised was to be seen not by him
        alone, but at least by Philip also, and probably by others. The
        meaning of the prediction is obscure. Evidently some great sign is
        promised; but what it is, interpreters are far from agreed. Some take
        the words metaphorically, others literally.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of those who
        understand them metaphorically, some take the sense to be: You shall
        see numerous miracles, such as are usually attributed to angels (or,
        in the performance of which angels shall minister to Me) wrought by
        Me, the Son of Man, during My public life. So Beelen, Maier, &amp;c.
        We cannot accept this view, for it seems highly improbable that our
        Lord would speak in language so obscure to the guileless Nathanael
        and his companions on an occasion like the present, when Nathanael
        had only just believed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others understand
        of the spiritual glories of the whole period from the commencement of
        Christ's public mission till the end of the world. Alford, explaining
        this view (which, by the way, he calmly claims to have been
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the interpretation of all commentators of
        any depth in all times”</span>!) says: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is
        not the outward visible opening of the material heavens nor ascent or
        descent of angels in the sight of men, which the Lord here announces,
        but the series of glories which was about to be unfolded in His
        Person and work, from that time forward.”</span> Our difficulty in
        regard to this view is the same as in regard to the preceding.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Augustine is
        generally supposed to have understood this text in reference to the
        preachers of the New Testament, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“ascending”</span> when they preach the more sublime,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“descending,”</span> when they preach the
        more elementary doctrines of religion. If St. Augustine meant this as
        a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">literal</span></em> interpretation of the
        passage, as he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg
        046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        certainly seems to do in Tract vii. on this Gospel, we cannot accept
        it. Surely, something stranger and more striking is promised here,
        after the opening of the heavens, than the sight of preachers!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others hold that
        we must interpret this passage entirely in the light of Jacob's
        dream, Gen. xxviii. 12. Jacob saw a ladder reaching from earth to
        heaven, with angels ascending and descending upon it. That vision
        meant in his regard that God would make him the object of His special
        protection (see Gen. xxviii. 13-15). And now Nathanael, who is
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">an
        Israelite indeed</span></span>, a true son of Jacob (v. 47), is told
        that he and others shall see that Divine favour and protection which
        Jacob's vision signified, extended in such an extraordinary manner to
        Christ, during His life, that it will be most manifest He is the Son
        of God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This view we
        regard as probable. The Fathers tell us that Nathanael was
        particularly well versed in the Scriptures, and our Lord's words
        might readily recall to his mind Jacob's dream, with all its
        significance of Divine favour and protection.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the opinions
        that attempt to explain the words literally, some may be dismissed at
        once. Thus there cannot be reference to the angels who appeared at
        Christ's birth, or after His temptations (Matt. iv. 11), for Christ
        speaks of an event still to come, whereas His birth and temptations
        were already past. Nor can there be reference to the transfiguration,
        even if we suppose angels to have been present; nor to the agony in
        the garden; nor to the resurrection; for on none of these occasions
        did Philip and Nathanael see the angels. Less improbable, perhaps, is
        the view that there is reference to the ascension, and the two angels
        that appeared then (Acts i. 10). But this opinion too we reject
        without hesitation. In the passage of the Acts referred to, St. Luke
        tells us: <span class="tei tei-q">“And while they were beholding Him
        going up to heaven, behold two men <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">stood by
        them</span></span> in white garments.”</span> Now, it is clear that
        angels who stood by the apostles and disciples, cannot possibly be
        those referred to here as <span class="tei tei-q">“ascending and
        descending upon the Son of Man.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A Lapide refers
        the prediction to some miraculous vision seen by the disciples during
        our Lord's life, and not recorded in the Gospels. But it seems
        improbable that the fulfilment of such a prediction would be passed
        over in silence by all the Evangelists.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, there is
        the opinion, which is held by Maldonatus, that there is reference to
        the last judgment, when the heavens shall be opened, and Christ shall
        come riding on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg
        047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        clouds of heaven, accompanied by angels, and all men shall be forced
        to confess Him God. This seems to us the most probable
        interpretation. For, first, it is likely that our Lord refers to the
        clearest and most incontrovertible proof that shall be given of His
        Divinity; and such will be His coming in majesty to judge the world.
        Secondly, we know that on another occasion, when he was challenged by
        the Jewish High Priest to say if he was the Son of God, He appealed
        to this same proof of His Divinity: <span class="tei tei-q">“I adjure
        thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou be the Christ, the
        Son of God. Jesus saith to him: Thou hast said it. Nevertheless, I
        say to you: Hereafter you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the
        right hand of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of
        heaven”</span> (Matt. xxvi. 63-64). Probably the expression:
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">ascending and
        descending</span></span> is to be understood metaphorically, even in
        this opinion, and means merely that the angels shall be <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">attendant
        upon</span></em> the great Judge, ready to execute His will. The
        order is remarkable: they are said first to ascend, and then to
        descend, as was the case also in Jacob's vision.</p>

        was on the table. When we take into account what Mary says to the
        servants (v. 5), it is plain that her object in telling Jesus that
        the wine had run short, was not that He and His disciples might
        retire (Bengel), nor that He might exhort the company to patience
        (Calvin), nor that He might buy wine (Kuin.), but that He might work
        a miracle. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Mother of the Lord having
        heard of the testimony of the Baptist, and seeing the disciples
        gathered round her Son, the circumstances of whose miraculous birth
        she treasured in her heart (Luke ii. 19, 51) must have looked now at
        length for the manifestation of His power, and thought that an
        occasion only was wanting. Yet even so she leaves all to His
        will”</span> (Westc., in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        not in the Greek text (τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί γύναι?), which would therefore
        be better translated: <span class="tei tei-q">“What to Me and to
        thee, woman?”</span> The Revised Version of the Church of England
        renders: <span class="tei tei-q">“Woman, what have I to do with
        thee?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most Protestant
        writers have held that these words of our Lord contain a reproof of
        His mother. Among Catholics many have held that the words contain
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        semblance</span></em> of reproof; to teach us, not Mary, that we are
        not to be influenced by motives of flesh and blood in the service of
        God. Others have held (and this is the general opinion of modern
        Catholic commentators) that the words do not contain even the
        appearance of reproof.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) It is now
        generally acknowledged even by Protestant commentators that the term
        γύναι is not reproachful or disrespectful. According to Alford there
        is no reproach in the term, but rather respect; and Trench says:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“So far from any harshness, the compellation
        has something solemn in it”</span> (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Miracles</span></span>,
        p. 100). Liddell and Scott's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Lexicon</span></span>, says: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is often used as a term of respect or affection,
        mistress, lady.”</span> Yet Calvin impiously asserts that our Lord
        does not deign to call Mary His Mother: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Deinde cur simplici repulsa non contentus eam in
        vulgarem <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg
        050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        mulierum ordinem cogit, nec jam matris nomine dignatur?”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Why doubt of the heavenly origin of a
        reformation wrought by such reasoning as this?”</span>
        (McCarthy).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Father Coleridge
        thinks that Mary is addressed here by the title γύναι because that is
        <span class="tei tei-q">“what we may call her official and
        theological title ... for she is the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘woman’</span> of whom our Lord was born; she is the
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘woman’</span> of whom God spake to our first
        parents when He made them the promise of a Redeemer after the fall;
        she is the <span class="tei tei-q">‘woman’</span> to whom the whole
        range of types look forward, who was to conceive and compass a man
        (Jer. xxxi. 22); she is the <span class="tei tei-q">‘woman,’</span>
        the second Eve, as our Lord is the Man, and the Son of Man, the
        second Adam.”</span><a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href=

        whatever may be thought of this view, enough has been said to show
        that the term γύναι does not imply reproof or disrespect.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) Neither does
        the phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“What to Me and to thee?”</span>
        (τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί?). We find exactly the same phrase in Judg. xi. 12;
        3 Kings xvii. 18; 4 Kings iii. 13; 2 Paral. xxxv. 21; Mark v. 7; Luke
        viii. 28.<a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(A). After a
        candid examination of these texts, it must, we think, appear that the
        meaning of the phrase is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></em>: What does this concern you and
        Me? for in some, if not all, of the passages cited the phrase cannot
        have that meaning. Besides, is it likely Jesus would say that the
        wants of the poor, who were His hosts, and perhaps His relatives, and
        their shame consequent upon those wants, did not concern Him?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(B). Neither is
        the meaning: What have I to do with you, or, what have I in common
        with you? (as author of a miracle such as you suggest); it must
        proceed from My Divine nature, while only My human nature has been
        derived from you (so Augus., Tolet., Patriz.). For—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) This
        is not the meaning of the phrase in the parallel passages.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Christ
        gives a different reason: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">My hour is not yet come.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) His
        person hypostatically united to His human nature, had that nature in
        common with her, and it is of His person (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">mihi</span></span>), not of His Divine nature
        merely that He speaks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(C). What the
        precise meaning of the phrase is, it is difficult to determine with
        certainty. In all the passages where it occurs, it seems to indicate
        some divergence between the thoughts or wishes of the persons so
        brought together. Most probably it is here a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">remonstrance</span></em>; <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> because the suggestion that Christ should
        work a miracle is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">inconvenient or inopportune</span></em>,
        inasmuch as it brings moral pressure to bear upon Him to make Him
        begin His miracles before the time at which, prescinding from this
        suggestion, His public miracles were to begin. Something similar are
        the words of God to Moses: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Let Me
        alone</span></span>, that My wrath may be kindled against them, and
        that I may destroy them”</span> (Exod. xxxii. 10). On that occasion
        God, after remonstrating, granted the prayer of Moses, just as on
        this occasion, after remonstrating, He yielded to the suggestion of
        His Mother. So St. Cyril of Alex., St. Amb., Corl, &amp;c.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether the above
        be the correct meaning of the phrase or not, one thing is clear,
        against Calvin, Alf., Trench, &amp;c., that the words cannot contain
        a rebuke—not a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">real</span></em> rebuke; because there was no
        fault on Mary's part, not even venial (Council of Trent, sess. vi.,
        can. 23). St. Aug., whose authority Protestants must respect,
        whatever they may think of that of the Council of Trent, says:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“De Sancta Maria Virgine, propter honorem
        Christi, nullam prorsus quando de peccato agitur volo habere
        quaestionem”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">De Natura et Gratia</span></span>, ch. xxxvi.).
        Moreover, if the Blessed Virgin were guilty of any fault, it would be
        either because of the thing suggested, or of some circumstance of
        time, place, motive, &amp;c. Now, our Lord granted what she
        suggested; the object was therefore, good. The circumstances were the
        very same when the miracle was wrought as when it was suggested. As
        to her motive, it may have been good—charity for the poor. Why, then,
        ascribe a bad motive, such as vanity, without convincing proof? That
        the suggestion was acceded to, goes to show that it was made in
        circumstances in which it was not displeasing to God.<a id=
        "noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Neither is there
        in the words a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">feigned</span></em> rebuke, that is, feigned for
        our instruction, to show us that we are not to regard flesh and blood
        in doing the work of God (Mald., Tolet., &amp;c.); for Christ
        actually did what was suggested; and, besides, it is Catholic
        teaching that Christ in heaven grants many requests to His Mother,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">because</span></em> she is His Mother.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In vain, then,
        have Protestants tried to find, in these words of our Lord, anything
        derogatory to the dignity of His Blessed Mother. To every
        interpretation which would give such a sense to His words, we may
        answer, with St. Justin, Martyr: <span class="tei tei-q">“Non verbo
        matrem objurgavit qui facto honoravit.”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He reproved not His <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class=

        He did.”</span></p>

        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">My hour is not yet
        come.</span></span> In our interpretation it is easy to explain these
        words. His hour is not the hour of His death, nor the time when the
        want of wine would be fully felt, but the time at which, according to
        the ordinary providence of God, and prescinding from His Mother's
        suggestion, His public miracles were to begin.</p><a name="II_5" id=

        of the Jews in the matter of ablutions, see Matt. xv. 2; Mark vii.
        2-5. The μετρητής was a Greek liquid measure, containing about nine
        gallons, or, to be accurate, eight gallons 7.4 pints. There were six
        jars, or water-pots, each containing two or three measures. If each
        jar contained two measures, the whole quantity of wine miraculously
        provided would be = 6 × 2 × 9 = 108 gallons. If each contained three
        measures, the whole would be = 6 × 3 × 9 = 162 gallons. The quantity
        of wine miraculously produced was therefore very great, being at
        least about 108 gallons. It is absurd, however, to seek in this
        miracle of our Divine Lord any excuse for intemperance. As well might
        God be accused of conniving at intemperance, because He fills the
        grape each year with the moisture of earth and heaven, and then
        transmutes this into the nobler juices which He knows man will
        convert into wine. He gives in every case, that we may use, not that
        we may abuse. If the quantity of wine miraculously provided on this
        occasion was large, we ought to remember that the marriage feast
        lasted for a week; that there were probably many guests present,
        whose number was considerably increased by the invitation, at the
        last moment, of Christ and His disciples on their arrival from Judea;
        that others would probably be attracted now by the fame of this
        miracle, and the desire to see Him who had wrought it; and, finally,
        that the quantity of the wine made the miracle more striking.</p>

        more likely that the reference is to their drawing the water from the
        well in order to fill the water-pots. But if the reference be to
        drawing the wine from the pots (in v. 8 the same Greek verb is used
        in reference to that action), then the wine is called water because
        it had been water so recently, just as the serpent is called a rod in
        Exod. vii. 12. because it had been a rod immediately before. It is
        most likely that the conversion took place in the water-pots, and not
        on the way from them to the table.</p>

        the largest town of Galilee, was situated, on the western shore of
        the sea of Galilee (Matt. iv. 13, John vi. 24), and the journey to it
        from Cana is rightly described as a descent. During His public life
        our Lord seems to have dwelt chiefly in this town, which is therefore
        sometimes spoken of as His own city (see Matt. ix. 1, and compare
        with Mark ii. 1). It was long thought to be impossible to identify
        the site of Capharnaum, but it seems now to be practically certain
        that the site is that of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg

        modern Tell Hûm, about two and a half miles south-west of the point
        where the Jordan enters the sea of Galilee. Capharnaum means the
        village (נפר) of Nahum. <span lang="ar" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="ar"><span style="font-style: italic">Tell</span></span> is
        the Arabic for a hillock covered with ruins, and it is reasonably
        conjectured that Hûm is a contraction for Nahum, the first syllable,
        as sometimes happens in such cases, being dropped. Thus Tell Hûm
        would mean the ruin-clad hillock of Nahum. A summary of the various
        reasons for identifying the two places is given by Pére Didon, in his
        able work: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Finally did our Lord speak altogether of His
        resurrection so as to exclude all allusion to rebuilding the temple
        which stood before Him? I must confess that ... I cannot read the
        passage without being convinced that He spoke of both”</span>
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lect. on
        the Euch.</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg
        058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> p.
        135, No. 4). We, however, cannot bring ourselves to adopt this view
        against what seems to be the clear sense according to the
        interpretation of the inspired Evangelist, who tells us, (v. 21),
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">But He
        spoke of the temple of His body</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) There is the
        common answer, that He spoke ambiguously and allowed them to be
        deceived, because they were unworthy of plainer speech. They were
        not, however, necessarily deceived, for ναός (a temple) was used
        frequently in reference to the human body (see, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, 1
        Cor. iii. 16, 17; vi. 19; 2 Cor. vi. 16), and our Lord's language
        might have given them some reason for suspecting that it was of His
        body He spoke. For the two verbs, which he used λύσατε and ἐγερῶ
        though they could be understood in reference to the temple of stone,
        applied more appropriately to His body; the former signifying the
        breaking up or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">loosing</span></em> of the union between His
        soul and body; the latter, the raising of the body to life, as so
        often in St. Paul. See, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, 1 Cor. xv. 4, 12, 14,

        death, but a permission like what He said to Judas: <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">That which thou dost,
        do quickly</span></span> (John xiii. 27). It was usual with the
        Prophets to announce their predictions in the form of a command; as,
        for instance, Isaias (xlvii. 1): <span class="tei tei-q">“Come down,
        sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon.”</span></p>

        of the temple by Herod the Great is said by Josephus, in Antiq. xv.
        11, 1, to have been begun in the eighteenth year of his reign; in B.
        Jud. i. 21, 1, in the fifteenth; the difference arising from the fact
        that in one case Josephus counts from the death of Antigonus, in the
        other from Herod's appointment by the Romans. (See Antiq. xvii. 8,
        1.) Reckoning from the latter, we have twenty years till the birth of
        Christ, and thirty years since that event, making fifty, from which,
        however, four must be subtracted, because our era is four years too
        late. This gives forty-six years. The mere building of the temple
        took only nine years and a half, but during the remainder of the time
        it was decorated. These decorations were still going on, and were not
        completed till 64 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        perhaps, not understanding the words at all, he may have pretended to
        misunderstand, in order to get Christ to explain. His motive, at all

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the truth contained in verse 3, with an

        This formula indicates the importance of the pronouncement. It has
        been defined by the Council of Trent—(<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) that
        there is question in this fifth verse of natural water, and
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">b</span></span>) of that natural water as
        necessary for Baptism. <span class="tei tei-q">“Si quis dixerit aquam
        veram et naturalem non esse de necessitate baptismi, atque ideo verba
        illa D. N. J. C.: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Nisi quis renatus fuerit
        ex aqua, et Spiritu Sancto,’</span> ad metaphoram aliquam detorserit,
        anathema sit”</span> (Sess. vii. Can. 2. De bapt.).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This solemn
        declaration of the infallible Church settles, for Catholics, the
        question as to whether there is reference here to Christian Baptism.
        But even against heretics, for whom the Council of Trent speaks in
        vain, it is not difficult to show that there must be reference here
        to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Christian Baptism</span></em>. For (1) it cannot
        be denied that Christ inaugurated some external rite of baptism (John
        iii. 25, 26; iv. 11). (2) Christ and His disciples are represented
        (verse 22) as beginning to baptize after this discourse with
        Nicodemus. (3) Every circumstance of this second birth spoken of to
        Nicodemus is found in Christian Baptism. (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) Here
        we are said to be born again; so, too, are we in
        Baptism:—<span class="tei tei-q">“According to His mercy He saved us
        by the laver of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">regeneration</span></em> and renovation of the
        Holy Ghost”</span> (Tit. iii. 5). (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) This
        second birth is necessary that we may be saved and enter the kingdom
        of God; so is Christian Baptism (Mark xvi. 16; Acts iii. 37, 38),
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">c</span></span>) This second birth is through
        water and the Holy Ghost; so is Baptism. See Acts viii. 36-47; Tit.
        iii. 5.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seeing that there
        is reference in the text to Christian Baptism, the word <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“water”</span> in the text, as the Council of Trent
        defined, is to be understood, not metaphorically, but literally.
        Moreover, since this new birth is attributed to the water as to the
        Holy Ghost <span class="tei tei-q">“(ex aqua et Spiritu
        Sancto”</span>), water is not merely an empty symbol in the
        sacrament, but an efficient cause of grace like the Holy Ghost; He
        being the principal, the water the instrumental, efficient
        cause.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg
        063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This new birth in
        Baptism implies—(1) that we die to the old man of sin, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“for we are buried together with Him by Baptism into
        death”</span> (Rom. vi. 4). It implies (2) that we are born through
        the divine gift of God's grace to a new and spiritual life, in which
        we are His adopted children. <span class="tei tei-q">“So do you also
        reckon that you are dead to sin, but <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alive</span></em>
        unto God in Christ Jesus our Lord”</span> (Rom. vi. 11).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may remark,
        before passing from this text—(1) against the Pelagians and
        Anabaptists, that Baptism is here declared necessary for all who have
        been born, and therefore for infants before the use of reason; (2)
        against the Calvinists and Socinians, who hold that children of
        Christian parents need not be baptized, that no exception is here
        made in favour of the children of Christians; (3) against
        Protestants, that water in Baptism is not a mere symbol of
        regeneration, but is as truly its efficient cause as the Holy Ghost
        Himself; with this difference, however, that whereas the water is the
        instrumental, the Holy Ghost is the principal, cause.</p>

        takes place is no proof of its impossibility, nor a reason for

        depends upon the meaning given to the first <span class=

        page 262). Others understand the first spirit here of the wind; and
        this is the more common opinion among commentators. In this view, by
        means of a simple and obvious illustration from nature, Christ shows
        Nicodemus that he must believe in the possibility of this second
        birth, even though he know not the manner in which it takes place.
        The wind bloweth where it listeth, and you know not whence it cometh
        or whither it goeth: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        "font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, Gen. vii. 1; Ps. civ. 4;

        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">so is it</span></span>,
        &amp;c.), according to the patrons of this second opinion. Nor does
        the fact that it is preceded by the article here oblige us, according
        to these, to refer it to the Holy Ghost; for, just as in verse 5,
        without the article, it refers to the Holy Ghost, so here, with the
        article, it may not refer to Him.</p>

        John <a href="#VIII_28" class="tei tei-ref">viii. 28</a>; <a href=
        "#XII_32" class="tei tei-ref">xii. 32-34</a>), to save those who
        believe in Him. The best supported Greek reading of verse 15 would be
        rendered:—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">That everyone who believes may, through him, have
        eternal life</span></span>; μὴ ἀπόληται αλλ᾽ (may not perish, but)
        not being genuine, and ἐν αὐτώ standing instead of εἰς αὐτόν. Though
        faith is the only condition to salvation which is mentioned in verse
        15, others are supposed, as is evident from verse 5:—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Unless a man be born again.”</span> &amp;c. Faith,
        however, is often specially referred to, because as the Council of
        Trent (Sess. vi., c. 8) says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Fides est
        humanae salutis initium, fundamentum, et radix omnis
        justificationis.”</span></p>

        his works may be approved. The antithesis between this and the
        preceding verse, shows that the manifestation of which there is
        question here is equivalent to approval; and indeed, from the nature
        of the case, the manifestation of such works in the light of
        Christian truth would be necessarily followed by their approval, not
        only by God, but also by the enlightened judgment of him who wrought

        These words may be differently connected. They may give the reason
        why he who does good, readily comes to the light, namely, because his
        works have been good, and he is not afraid to have them tested. Or,
        they might be understood to give the reason why such a one's works
        are approved, namely because they are done in God. Or again, ὅτι may
        be taken to mean not, <span class="tei tei-q">“because,”</span> but
        <span class="tei tei-q">“that;”</span> and then the sense will be,
        that he who does good comes to the light and believes, that his works
        may be made manifest as having been (that they have been) done in
        God. The last is perhaps the simplest and most natural
        interpretation, but the first also is probable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in any of
        these interpretations, the question arises—how can the works of a man
        who has not yet believed, be said to have been <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“done in God.”</span> Various answers have been given. We
        cannot agree with those commentators who reply that there is question
        of future works to be performed after the reception of faith; for the
        whole context, and the Greek text (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">have been</span></span>
        done), show that there is question of past works done before their
        author has come to the light. Nor do we think that there is question
        merely of natural works done in the past with the aid of medicinal
        grace, for such works would scarcely be said to have been
        <span class="tei tei-q">“done in God.”</span> We hold, then, that
        there is reference to the <span class="tei tei-q">“initium
        fidei,”</span> that is to say, to all those works that sprang from
        supernatural grace, were salutary in themselves, and led up to faith.
        These are the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg
        069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        only works of one who has not yet believed, that can be properly said
        to have been done in God, done according to His will and pleasure.
        That there are such works antecedent to faith, cannot be denied; for
        the proposition: <span class="tei tei-q">“Faith is the first
        grace,”</span> put forward in the schismatical Council of Pistoia,
        was condemned by Pius VI., in the Bull <span class=

        fide</span></span>, against the Semipelagians, that supernatural
        grace is necessary for the <span class="tei tei-q">“initium
        fidei,”</span> from which it follows that the works included in the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“initium fidei,”</span> are salutary, and
        <span class="tei tei-q">“done in God.”</span></p>

        valley, about seven and a-half miles from Beisan (Scythopolis), there
        is a remarkable group of seven springs, all lying within a radius of

        Others, however, think, from the connection between this verse and

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">29. By a familiar
        example the Baptist illustrates the difference between himself and
        Christ. On the occasion of a Jewish marriage it was usual for the
        bridegroom to have a friend (<span class="tei tei-q">“amicus
        sponsi,”</span> corresponding to the παράνυμφος of the Greeks), whose
        duty it was to arrange the preliminaries to the marriage, and at the
        marriage feast to minister to the bridegroom. The sense of the
        Baptist's words then is, that though many are present to a wedding,
        only one, he who hath the bride, is the bridegroom. His friend, who
        has helped to bring about the marriage, is satisfied to stand and
        minister to him, rejoicing exceedingly to hear the bridegroom
        speaking with his bride, nor jealous of the happy relations which
        subsist between them. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">This, my joy, therefore, is
        fulfilled.</span></span> In these words the Baptist points the
        application of the comparison to Christ and himself. The Baptist is
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“amicus sponsi,”</span> who prepared the
        disciples for Christ; Christ is the bridegroom, and the disciples
        flocking to Christ (verse 26) were to constitute the Church, which is
        His spouse. See 2 Cor. xi. 2; Eph. v. 25, 27.</p>

        that private worship, as of prayer, should be restricted to
        Jerusalem. The mountain to which she refers, and beneath the shadow
        of which Christ and she were standing, is Mount Garizim, which
        overhangs the town of Sichar. In the time of Alexander the Great,
        Manasses, a Jewish priest, was excluded from the exercise of his
        ministry for marrying the daughter of the king of Sichem. The king
        accordingly built for Manasses a temple on Mount Garizim, where he
        offered sacrifice to the true God. This temple was built about 330
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, and stood for two
        hundred years. After it was destroyed, about 130 <span class=

        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, the Samaritans erected
        an altar upon Garizim, and continued to offer sacrifice there; so
        that from the time of Manasses the true God was worshipped, though
        imperfectly, among them. There still remain a few families of
        Samaritans, under the shadow of Mount Garizim, in the modern city of
        Nabulus, or Naplouse.</p>

        make known all that it is necessary to know regarding the place and
        character of the worship of the true God. As the Samaritans admitted
        only the Pentateuch, where the term Messias is not used (though His
        coming is foretold, Deut. xviii. 18); as, moreover, she could not
        have gathered from the Pentateuch the <em class=

        His coming, she must have learned by rumour that the Jews were
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at this

        this ruler of Capharnaum may have been an officer of Herod Antipas,
        the Tetrarch of Galilee. Doubtless the ruler had heard of the miracle
        at the marriage feast in Cana (ii. 7, 11); and perhaps he had
        witnessed the evidence of Christ's miraculous power at the feast of
        the Pasch (ii. 23).</p>

        be admitted between the events now about to be narrated and the
        preceding, depends upon the answer to be given to the question: what
        festival is here referred to? On this question a great diversity of
        opinion has always existed among commentators. The more common
        opinion is that it is the festival of the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Pasch</span></span>; others, however, hold that
        it is the festival of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Pentecost</span></span>, or of <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Tabernacles</span></span>, or of the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Purification</span></span> of the Temple, or of
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Lots</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Pasch was
        celebrated from the evening of the 14th till that of the 21st of
        Nisan, the first month of the Jewish sacred year. Pentecost was the
        fiftieth day from the second day of the Pasch. The feast of
        Tabernacles was celebrated from the evening of the 14th till that of
        the 22nd of Tisri, the seventh month of the sacred year. The feast of
        Purification lasted eight days, beginning with the 25th Casleu, the
        ninth month of the sacred year. The feast of Lots lasted two days,
        the 14th and 15th of Adar, the twelfth month of the sacred year.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The three feasts
        of Pasch, Pentecost, and Tabernacles were the great Jewish feasts, on
        which, and on which alone, all adult males were bound to <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> go up to Jerusalem to worship. See Exod.
        xxiii. 14-17; xxxiv. 18, 22, 23. Many have held that the approach of
        the feast is mentioned (verse 1), as giving the reason why Christ
        went up, like the other adult Jewish men, to Jerusalem (ii. 13).
        Others, however, hold that the text merely states a fact, that Christ
        went up on the occasion of a festival, without implying at all that
        the festival was such as ought to be celebrated at Jerusalem.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is difficult,
        if not impossible, to definitely decide which feast is meant; but it
        seems to us extremely probable that it is either Pasch or Lots. In
        favour of the Pasch it is argued—(1) (ἑορτὴ) even without the
        article<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href=
        "#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a>
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">may</span></em> designate the Pasch (Matt.
        xxvii. 15; Mark xv. 6); and it is to be believed that it does in the
        present instance, because ten verses before (iv. 45) the same word is
        used to designate the Pasch (compare John ii. 13, 23). (2) From iv.
        35 we learn that Jesus was on His way, through Samaria, to Galilee,
        in December; that is, about the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">close</span></em> of the first year of His
        public life. Hence it cannot be to any of the three great feasts of
        that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">first</span></em> year that our text refers.
        Naturally, then, it is to the Pasch of the second year, which was the
        first great feast to occur in the course of the year, and for which,
        if Christ had not gone to Jerusalem, St. John would probably have
        explained His absence, as He does (vii. 1) in reference to the Pasch
        mentioned vi. 4. (3) Were it any other feast than that of the Pasch,
        which was by excellence <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">the</span></em> feast of the Jews, St. John,
        according to his custom (vii. 2; x. 22), would have named it. (4)
        This is the opinion of St. Irenæus, who was a disciple of Polycarp,
        himself a disciple of our Evangelist.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In favour of the
        feast of Lots—(1) The absence of the article in the more probable
        reading points to one of the minor feasts of the Jews. (2) From John
        iv. 35, and vi. 4, it would seem to be clear that this feast fell
        between December and the Pasch; but only the feast of Lots occurred
        at that time. (3) If this be the second Pasch of our Lord's public
        life, and that in vi. 4 the third, then the events of a whole year
        are passed over by our Evangelist, who proceeds, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in vi. 1: <span class="tei tei-q">“After
        these things Jesus went,”</span> &amp;c., affording no hint that he
        has passed over the events of a year. (4). Were this the Pasch, St.
        John would have named it, as he does on the other three occasions
        (ii. 13; vi. 4; xi. 55). But as it was only a minor feast of the
        Jews, and probably unheard-of by the Christians of Asia Minor, the
        Evangelist thinks it unnecessary to name it, and contents himself
        with referring to it as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">a feast of the Jews</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is perhaps
        impossible, as we have said already, to decide with certainty which
        feast is meant, but we shall follow the more common opinion and hold
        that there is question of the Pasch. Thus, we hold that St. John
        mentions four Paschs as having occurred during our Lord's public
        life: the first in ii. 13; the second here; the third in vi. 4; and
        the fourth and last in xii. 1 and xiii. 1, when our Lord was put to
        death. He passes over the events that occurred between the second and
        third Pasch, because they were already narrated by the Synoptic
        Evangelists.</p>

        Syro-Chaldaic, which was the language of Palestine at this time,
        means the house (place) of mercy; and the name was given in the
        present instance on account of the merciful cures wrought there. For
        the building of this sheep-gate by the priests, see 2 Esd. iii. 1.
        The site of either gate or pond cannot be determined with certainty;
        but the pond seems to have been close to the Temple, near the gate
        through which the sheep to be sacrificed entered within the outer
        enclosure of the temple. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">porches</span></span>, which served to shelter the

        pond might be so called because the sheep were washed there before
        they were sacrificed; others, because their entrails were brought
        there to be washed. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the whole of verse 4, is disputed. The Council
        of Trent, indeed, defined <span class="tei tei-q">“libros singulos
        cum omnibus suis partibus ... prout in vulgata Latina Editione
        habentur ... pro sacris et canonicis esse suscipiendos:”</span> but
        it is not thereby defined that every tittle (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">particula</span></span>) or every verse, is
        canonical Scripture. It would seem, therefore, that Catholics are
        free to reject this passage, and it is a question for criticism to
        decide whether we are to receive or reject it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After an
        examination of the evidence for and against, we believe that the
        passage is more probably genuine. It stands in codex A
        (Alexandrinus), and in at least ten other uncial and very many
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">cursive</span></em> MSS. It is read in the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Vetus Itala”</span> and in the Vulgate; in
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">figured</span></em>
        Syriac versions, and in the Persian, Coptic, and Arabian versions. It
        is read by Cyril of Alexandria, Chrys., Theophy., Euthy., Tertull.,
        Ambr., and August. Finally, the context, especially the reply of the
        sick man (verse 7), supposes it. Why it came to be wanting in so many
        MSS. it is difficult to explain.<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the wonderful
        efficacy here attributed to the water of this pond was miraculous,
        and not merely, as the Rationalists would have us believe, the effect
        of salubrious natural properties in the water, seems clear. For—(1)
        there is the intervention of an angel which disturbed (ἐτάρασσε) the
        water; (2) only the first person entering the pond was cured; (3) he
        was cured not gradually, but at once, and completely: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“he was immediately made whole;”</span> (4) he was cured
        no matter what his disease. When the Rationalists find for us an

        attributed to Bethesda, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg

        with and heals a man who had been thirty-eight years ill (of
        paralysis or some similar disease, as would appear from verses 7-8);
        and, to show how complete the cure was, perhaps also to give an
        occasion for the discourse which follows, He orders the man who has
        been cured to take up his bed and walk. It would be a rather severe
        trial of recovered strength to have to carry some of the beds of
        modern times; but that on which the poor paralytic had been resting
        was not cumbrous. It was probably only a carpet or mattress, or at
        most there was but a very light framework. In Acts v. 15, we find the
        term used in our text distinguished from κλίνη, which was rather the

        to make Himself equal to God, and He goes on not to withdraw, but to
        reiterate and expand what He had said. He declares His operation as
        God to be identical with that of the Father; in a word, His works to
        be the works of God. He had received, in His eternal generation, His
        Divine nature and operation identical with the Father's, and as God
        He does nothing except what the Father does, and the Father does
        nothing except what He does. This inability to work of Himself, that
        is to say, alone, without the Father (<span lang="la" class=

        Arians appealed to this verse to prove the inferiority of the Son to
        the Father, because, they said, Christ here declares Himself merely
        an imitator of the works of the Father, just as a pupil or apprentice
        imitates his master. But Christ's words, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        and the Father are one”</span> (x. 30), show that there can be no
        question here of inferiority; and, moreover, since <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em>
        things were made by the Son (i. 3), it was impossible for Him to copy
        from anything made beforehand.</p>

        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">similiter</span></em>).”</span> And St.
        Augustine on this verse says beautifully: <span class="tei tei-q">“He
        does not say whatsoever the Father doeth, the Son does <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">other</span></em>
        things like them, but the very same things. The Father made the
        world, the Son made the world, the Holy Ghost made the world. If the
        Father, Son <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg
        097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and
        Holy Ghost, are one, it follows that one and the same world was made
        by the Father, through the Son, in the Holy Ghost. Thus it is the
        very same thing that the Son doth. He adds <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">likewise</span></em>,
        to prevent another error arising. For the body seems to do the same
        things with the mind, but it does not do them in a like way, inasmuch
        as the body is subject, the soul governing; the body visible, the
        soul invisible. When a slave does a thing at the command of his
        master, the same thing is done by both; but is it in a like way? Now
        in the Father and Son there is not this difference; they do the same
        things, and in a like way. Father and Son act with the same power; so
        that the Son is equal to the Father.”</span> Since then the works of
        the Son as God are the works of the Father, if they blamed the Son
        for violating the Sabbath, they thereby blamed the Father also. And
        it is of the Son <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        as man, or as God-man He could do many things <span class=

        waters, &amp;c., which, of course, the Father never did; and,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are not to
        conclude from this verse that the love of the Father is the cause of
        the communication of the Divine nature to the Son, as if the Son
        proceeded from the Father through love, and therefore through the
        Will. The common teaching of theologians is that the Son proceeds not
        through the Divine will, but through the Divine intellect. See Perr.
        De. Trin., § 401. Hence the meaning is not, that the Father loves the
        Son, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">therefore</span></em> communicates His Divine
        nature to Him. Toletus, however, thinks that this form of expression
        is purposely used here by Christ to show men that the Father shares
        His nature and power with the Son, since among men, those who love
        share <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name=

        were sick; now He would raise to life bodies that were dead. (2) In
        verse 28 there is certainly question of a corporal resurrection;
        therefore also here. (3) This raising of the dead was to excite the
        wonder of the Jews; therefore there must be question of the raising
        of the body, since a spiritual resurrection could not be known, and
        hence could not be a matter of wonder.</p>

        there is question of spiritual death and resurrection in verse 24;
        therefore also in verse 21. (2) The words <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And now is”</span> of verse 25 point to a resurrection
        then present, therefore to a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        context. The spiritual resurrection brought about by Christ, though
        in itself invisible, produced in the world effects <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more
        wonderful</span></em> than the curing of the paralytic, and it is as

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that He refers in verse 28 to the fact

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We prefer the
        latter view; but whichever view we may hold, we must bear in mind
        that the sense is not that the Father raises some, and the Son
        others, from the dead. As God, Christ's will is <em class=

        Some think it is the judgment of discussion, the trial which awaits
        all (Heb. ix. 27), that is referred to; others that (as in verses 24,
        29, and iii. 19) it is the judgment of condemnation passed upon the
        reprobate, the Greek word which is used being generally (if not
        always) used by St. John of the judgment of condemnation. When it is
        said here that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        gave all power to judge to Christ as God in the eternal generation,

        the indirect testimony of the Father through Christ's miracles,
        another testimony of His is now appealed to. Some understand this of
        the testimony of the Father on the occasion of Christ's baptism,
        (Matt. iii. 17). So Chrys., A Lap., M'Ev. But if there were reference
        to that past and definite occasion, the Greek <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> aorist, not the perfect, would be used.
        Others, as Mald., connect this verse closely with the preceding, and
        hold the reference is still to the Father's testimony given through
        Christ's miracles. But the form of words: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And the Father Himself, who hath sent Me, hath given
        testimony of Me,”</span> seems to add another distinct testimony to
        those already mentioned. Others, therefore, hold that the reference
        is to the Father's testimony conveyed through the oracles of the
        prophets. So St. Cyril, Theoph., Euthy., Kuin., Corl.; and this
        opinion seems to be the correct one.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About the meaning
        and connection of the words which follow in this verse and the next,
        there is a great variety of view.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) Some thus: But
        you have never listened to His voice speaking to you through the
        Sacred Scriptures, nor recognised Him as speaking in them, nor do you
        believe in His inspired word; and the reason of this is, because you
        do not believe in Me whom He has sent. (Patriz.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) Others thus:
        But though the Father has testified of Me, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“neither have you heard His voice ... abiding in
        you;”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, you have been excluded from
        familiarity with Him, and from belief in His testimony, because you
        refuse to believe in Me. (Hengstenberg.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) Others take
        the words to refer to the covenant entered into by God with the Jews
        (Deut. xviii. 15-19), that He should terrify them no more by His
        awful presence, as when He gave the law on Sinai (Exod. xx. 19-21),
        but should speak to them through a prophet. Hence Christ's words
        signify: The Father has borne testimony of Me, nor has He broken His
        word to you, that you should hear and see no more the terrifying
        sounds and sights of Sinai; and yet you refuse to keep your part of
        the compact (<span class="tei tei-q">“you have not His word abiding

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">39. Here our Lord
        distinctly mentions the testimony to which He had already alluded
        (verse 37). <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">Search the Scriptures</span></span>, or rather,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Ye search the
        Scriptures</span></span>. In both the Greek and Latin texts the form
        of the verb leaves it doubtful whether it is to be understood as an
        indicative or an imperative. But the context, in which all the verbs
        are in the indicative, and the course of the argument, render it much
        more probable that the form is to be understood as an indicative. So,
        too, all the best modern commentators, even among the Protestants;
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, Kuin., Alf., Bloomf.,
        Westc., and the Revised Version, which renders: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ye search the Scriptures.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is unnecessary
        then to delay long in refuting the argument which used to be drawn by
        Protestants from this text in favour of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">indiscriminate</span></em> reading of the Bible
        by all the faithful. A few words will suffice. (1) It is much more
        probable that the words do not contain a precept, but merely state a
        fact. (2) Even if they did contain a precept, they are addressed very
        probably only to the Jewish <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">teachers</span></em> (see verse <a href="#V_44"
        class="tei tei-ref">44</a>). (3) Even if we admitted that the words
        contain a precept, and are addressed to all the Jews, still it would
        not follow that all the faithful now are bound to read the Bible, nor
        that the Church may not sometimes, for grave reasons restrict the
        liberty to read it. For we must bear in mind that our Lord is here
        referring to the Sacred Scriptures in connection with one particular
        point, namely, the fulfilment of prophecy in Himself. Even if the
        Jews were authorized or commanded to read the Sacred Scriptures in
        regard to a particular question, it by no means follows that
        Protestants are commanded or even authorized to read them in order to
        form by the aid of private judgment an opinion on <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> all questions of faith and morals.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Catholic
        Church freely admits, of course, and insists that the reading of the
        Bible is in itself good and useful; but since the Bible contains
        <span class="tei tei-q">“certain things hard to be understood, which
        the unlearned and unstable wrest ... to their own destruction”</span>
        (2 Pet. iii. 16), hence she knows it is possible that, like all God's
        best gifts, the Bible may in certain circumstances be abused.</p>

        Palestine, and now, soon after the death of the Baptist (Matt. xiv.
        3, Mark vi. 17, Luke iii. 20) and the return of the Apostles from
        their first mission (Mark vi. 30; Luke ix. 10), we find Him in the
        northern province, by the shores of the Sea of Galilee. This sea or
        lake (the Jews called every large body of water a sea), which lay to
        the east of the province of Galilee, was called also the Sea of
        Tiberias, because of the town built by Herod Antipas, on its western
        shore, and named after the Roman Emperor Tiberius. It was also called
        sometimes the Lake of Gennesareth, from the fertile plain of that
        name on its N.W. shore. It is almost heart-shaped, with the narrow
        end towards the south, and its extent at present is 12-½ miles from
        north to south, by 8 miles at its widest part east to west. (Smith's

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may seem

        their recognising Him as the Messias, from the way He treated the
        Samaritans in similar circumstances (iv. 42, 43). And yet His action
        in the two cases is intelligible enough. The Jews looked for a
        Messias who would improve their external condition, free them from
        subjection to any foreign power, and set them up as a powerful
        nation. But the Samaritans <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg

        could have, and had, no such hope from the advent of a Jewish
        Messias. With the Jews, as we see in the present instance, the
        intention was to declare the Messias their King, and thus to throw
        off their allegiance to Rome. The consequence, of course, would have
        been great political excitement and rebellion, ending, doubtless, in
        the triumph of the Roman arms. But no matter what the success of such
        a rebellion, it would have prejudiced the Roman world against the
        teachings of Christ, and rendered more difficult the recognition of
        the spiritual character of Christ's kingdom.</p>

        answering their question, our Lord takes occasion from the miracle of
        the preceding day to raise their thoughts to a higher and more
        precious bread than that which He had miraculously given them. But
        first He tells them that they followed Him, not because they had
        realized the spiritual significance of His miracles, and believed Him
        to be God, but merely, He implies, because they hoped for a gross
        material satisfaction, such as they had experienced the preceding
        day. The Greek word, rendered: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">and were filled</span></em>, means literally;
        were satisfied with food, as animals with fodder.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having thus made
        known to them, that He knew their motive in following Him, He goes on
        to tell them to labour not, that is to say, not so much, for the food
        that perisheth as for that which endureth unto eternal life. This
        food enduring unto eternal life (verse 27) we understand to be the
        Blessed Eucharist.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But before giving
        our reasons for holding that reference to the Blessed Eucharist
        begins here, and not merely at verses 48, 51, or 52, it is desirable
        to indicate the Protestant interpretations of this discourse of our
        Lord, and prove that they are untenable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most Protestants
        deny that there is any reference to the Blessed Eucharist in this
        chapter; they hold that it refers merely to the reception of Christ
        through faith; and through faith especially in the atoning efficacy
        of His passion and death. It is of this faith in His passion that
        they interpret the words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Except you eat the
        flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, you shall not have life
        in you,”</span> (verse 54). Indeed they are logically constrained
        either to deny that there is reference here to the sacrament of the
        Eucharist, or else to abandon their teaching regarding the nature and
        efficacy of the sacraments. On the one hand, if they admit reference
        to the Eucharist, they see the difficulty of denying the real and
        substantial presence of Christ in the sacrament; on the other hand,
        holding, as they do, that the few sacraments which <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> they retain,<a id="noteref_55" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> are not
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">causes</span></em> of grace, as the Catholic
        Church teaches, but merely signs or pledges of grace, and external
        notes of the Church, they find themselves in direct conflict with our
        Lord, if His words are to be understood of the sacrament of the
        Eucharist. For again and again throughout this discourse He
        attributes salvation and grace to the eating of His flesh and the
        drinking of His blood, in such a way as to leave no room for doubt
        that whatever it is He speaks of, whether faith or the sacrament of
        the Eucharist, it is the cause of grace. See, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, 27,
        52, 55, 57, 59.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But besides those
        who deny that there is any reference to the Blessed Eucharist in this
        chapter, there is a considerable number of Protestants who take up
        even a more indefensible position. These admit the reference, but
        contend that nothing more can be concluded from this or any other
        part of Scripture than that Christ is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">spiritually</span></em> present in the
        Sacrament. They will not admit that Christ is really and
        substantially present, much less that the sacrament causes grace.
        Against the first class we shall show that Christ refers, in this
        discourse, to the Blessed Eucharist; and against the second, that His
        words prove that He is really and substantially received in the
        sacrament.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may premise
        that no more appropriate occasion could have been chosen by Christ
        for promising this heavenly bread than the day following that on
        which He had multiplied the bread in the desert; and we know that it
        was Christ's practice to explain His doctrines as they were suggested
        by circumstances. Thus, after curing the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">centurion's</span></em> servant, He foretells
        the vocation of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Gentiles</span></em> (Matt. viii. 6-13); after
        expelling the unclean spirit, He describes the power of Satan (Matt.
        xii. 22-45); after asking for water, He speaks of the water of life
        to the Samaritan woman (John iv. 10, and foll.); <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> after healing the paralytic, He predicts
        the general resurrection (John v. 28); and after curing the man born
        blind, He denounces the blindness of the Pharisees (John ix. 41). It
        was quite in accordance with Christ's practice, then, to predict the
        Blessed Eucharist on the present occasion: and that He did so is
        proved by the following arguments:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) If St. John
        did not mean to record here a reference to the Blessed Eucharist,
        then he does not mention that sacrament at all, for he does not
        allude, unless perhaps very obscurely (xiii. 1) to its institution.
        But it is very improbable that our Evangelist omits all mention of
        this sacrament in his Gospel. For if, as we shall prove, this
        sacrament contains the body and blood of Christ, there was a reason
        why St. John should mention it in order to confirm the faithful
        against the Docetae who denied the reality of Christ's human nature.
        Nor does it at all weaken this argument to say that the Docetae who
        denied the reality of the body in which Christ had walked and talked,
        would not be likely to be convinced by a reference to His body
        present in the Eucharist. For St. John wrote, not to convert
        heretics, but to confirm against heresy Christians who believed in
        the real presence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) Christ's words
        (27, 52) can refer only to the Eucharist. For He speaks of a food
        which was still to be given <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">in the future</span></em>, whereas His
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">doctrines</span></em>, and His <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Person</span></em> as
        the object of faith, had been given already.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) His words:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Amen, amen, I say unto you: Except you eat
        the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, you shall not have
        life in you”</span> (verse 54), could be understood only in a literal
        sense, and so understood, they must refer to the Blessed Eucharist.
        For, if Christ had spoken in a figurative sense, it should be in that
        figurative sense which was known and recognised among the Jews. Now,
        the recognised figurative sense of eating a man's flesh was to do him
        some serious injury, especially by calumny.<a id="noteref_57" name=
        "noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a> Such a
        figurative sense, however, would be absurd here; and hence Christ
        must have been understood, and must have spoken, in the literal
        sense. See Wiseman's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Lect. on the Euch.</span></span>, pp. 77-91.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) The disciples
        understood our Lord to speak of a real eating of His flesh and blood,
        such as takes place only in the Eucharist, and understood Him
        correctly. Their words (verse <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> 61), and their departure for ever from Him
        (verse 67), show that they understood Him of a real eating; otherwise
        why should they be offended or desert Him? What had He said that was
        new, or hard to take in, if He merely spoke of the necessity of faith
        in Himself or His doctrines? Their action, then, shows in what sense
        the disciples understood Him; and His action in permitting them to
        depart, shows they understood Him correctly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(5) The Jews
        understood Him of a real eating, which was quite different from
        belief in His doctrines or in Himself, and which has no meaning
        unless in reference to the Eucharist. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">His
        flesh</span></span> to eat?”</span> they said (verse 53); and His
        solemn asseveration, negatively (verse 54), and positively (verse
        55), shows that He is inculcating the very truth which they had
        questioned, and which they were bound to accept on His testimony,
        even though they could not see <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">how</span></em> it was to come to pass.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">II. <span class=

        "font-style: italic">really</span></em> received.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) After the Jews
        had murmured, Christ declared His flesh to be <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">truly</span></em>
        meat, and His blood to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">truly</span></em> drink (verse 56), and
        therefore it must be truly and really received.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) In any sense
        other than the literal, Christ's meaning would be obscure, and His
        words misleading; and our Evangelist, according to his ordinary
        practice (i. 41, 42; ii. 21; iv. 2; xii. 33), would explain. But he
        does not explain; therefore the language is not obscure, and
        therefore the literal sense was meant.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) See arguments
        (3), (4), and (5) for the preceding proposition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now, having
        satisfied ourselves that there is reference to the Blessed Eucharist
        in this chapter, and to a real, oral reception of Christ in the
        sacrament, let us try to decide where that reference begins. Some (as
        Wiseman, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Lect. on Euch.</span></span>, p. 51, and foll.)
        say at verse 48; others, at 51; and others, at 52. But it seems much
        more probable that the reference begins before any of these points;
        and Wiseman is certainly mistaken when he states, on page 48:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“That Protestants and Catholics are equally
        agreed that the discourse, as far as the 48th or 51st verse refers
        entirely to believing Christ. St. Cyril of Alex., Theophy., Toletus,
        Lucas of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg
        119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Bruges, had held, before Wiseman's time, that the reference to the
        Blessed Eucharist begins in verse 27”</span>; and since his time,
        Beelen, Perrone, Corluy, Franzelin,<a id="noteref_58" name=
        "noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a> and
        others have held the same.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most probable
        view seems to be that from verse 27, wherever there is question of
        the bread (verses 27, 32, 33, 35, ... 59), the Blessed Eucharist is
        meant. Christ began in verse 27 to promise the Blessed Eucharist, but
        the Jews interrupted Him (verse 28), and their interruption raised
        the question of faith in Him, so that He digressed for a time from
        His main purpose to explain the necessity of faith, in order to
        ensure a fruitful reception of the Eucharist. But though we admit
        this digression, we hold that wherever Christ refers to the bread to
        be given, He means the Blessed Eucharist, and that the reference to
        it begins in verse 27. For—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) In verse 27 He
        speaks of a food that was still <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">to be given in the future</span></em>, just as
        in verse 52, where all Catholics admit there is question of the
        Eucharist.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) This food was
        to be given by the Son of Man, Christ Himself; and though in verse 32
        the Father is said to give it, this is naturally explained by saying
        that the Father gives us in the Incarnation what Christ gives in a
        sacramental form in the Eucharist.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) The food in
        verse 27, is a food for which, as we shall see, faith is a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">preparation</span></em>; therefore, not itself
        faith.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) In verses 32,
        33, there is question of a bread that cometh down from heaven, and
        giveth life to the world, and in verse 59, of a bread to which the
        very same properties are attributed; and in both cases this
        heaven-descended, life-giving bread is contrasted with the manna. Is
        it not natural, then, to conclude, remembering that both passages
        belong to the same discourse, that the same bread is meant in both
        instances?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now we have
        seen—(1) that there is reference to the Blessed Eucharist in this
        discourse; (2) to a real reception of Christ in it; and (3) that the
        reference most probably begins in verse 27. Having got so far, it
        will not be very difficult to interpret the discourse, and to this we
        proceed at once.</p>

        endure unto eternal life.</p>

        now He had contented Himself with declaring that He is that bread,

        worthily; now He goes further, and points out <em class=

        will be the bread of life; namely, by giving His flesh, that is, His
        whole human nature (i. 14), to which the Divine nature is inseparably
        united, to be received in the Blessed Eucharist. Thus He <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> gradually unfolds the mystery, reserving
        till the last supper the further knowledge, that this reception of
        His body and blood was to take place in a sacramental manner.</p>

        My flesh, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">which I will give</span></em> for the life of
        the world.”</span> If the words <span class="tei tei-q">“which I will
        give”</span> be genuine, we would explain them not in reference to
        the sacrifice of the cross, but in reference to the sacrifice of the
        Eucharist, in which Christ is given for us and to us. Compare St.
        Luke: <span class="tei tei-q">“This is My body, which is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">given for
        you</span></em>”</span> (Luke, xxii. 19), and especially Luke xxii.
        20, where the Greek text shows that it is the blood <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as in the
        chalice</span></em> (and not as on Calvary) that is said to be
        offered in sacrifice. But the words more probably are not genuine;
        they are omitted by Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles, Westcott, and
        Hort, and by the Revised Version, as well as by the Vulgate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though not merely
        Christ's flesh, that is, His humanity (i. 14), but also His Divinity,
        is received in the Blessed Eucharist, His human nature is specially
        mentioned, lest it should be thought that He is the living bread only
        as God, or merely spiritually. <span class="tei tei-q">“Dixerat
        enim,”</span> says St. Thomas on this verse. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Quod erat panis vivus; et ne intelligatur quod hoc ei
        esset in quantum est Verbum, vel secundum animam tantum, ideo
        ostendit quod etiam caro sua vivificativa est: est enim organum
        divinitatis suae: unde, cum instrumentum agat virtute agentis, sicut
        divinitas Christi vivificativa est, ita et caro virtute Verbi
        adjuncti vivificat; unde Christus tactu suo sanabat infirmos.”</span>
        Besides, as St. Thomas adds, since this Sacrament is commemorative of
        our Lord's Passion (<span class="tei tei-q">“For as often as you
        shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall show the death
        of the Lord,”</span> 1 Cor. xi. 26), His <span class=

        of that human nature wherein it was <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        of bread only the body is present <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in virtue of the
        words of consecration</span></em>, and similarly under the species of
        wine only the blood; but since Christ's body is now a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">living</span></em>
        body, it follows that in the Blessed Eucharist, where the body is,
        there also are the blood and the soul <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in virtue of the
        natural connection</span></em> between the parts of a living body,
        and there, too, the Divinity, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">in virtue of the hypostatic union</span></em>.
        See Decrees of the Council of Trent, sess. xiii., ch. 3. The precept
        is to receive both body and blood, but not necessarily under both
        species. For, as the Council of Trent (sess. xxi., cap. 1) points
        out, Christ attributes the same effects to eating in verses 55, 58,
        59, as He does here to eating and drinking. See also 1 Cor. xi. 26,
        where he who eats <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">or</span></em> drinks unworthily, is said to be
        guilty of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">both</span></em> body and blood. The precept of
        Christ, then, is obeyed whether one or both species be received, and
        it is a disciplinary matter entrusted to the care of the Church,
        whether the faithful are to receive under one or both species.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seeing, then, that
        there is no obligation for the faithful to receive the Blessed
        Eucharist under both species, it may be asked why does Christ mention
        both species? We reply, that He does so to signify that in the
        Blessed Eucharist there is a perfect repast, which ordinarily
        supposes the presence of both meat and drink; and, perhaps, also to
        indicate that this sacrament is commemorative of His death, in which
        His body and blood were separated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor do verses 54
        and 55 afford any proof that the Blessed Eucharist is necessary,
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">necessitate medii</span></span> unto salvation,
        like Baptism (John iii. 5). For—(1) Baptism is declared to be
        absolutely necessary for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg
        128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        all, <span class="tei tei-q">“unless a man be born again;”</span>
        here the Blessed Eucharist is declared necessary only for those who
        are capable of receiving a precept, <span class="tei tei-q">“Unless
        you eat,”</span> &amp;c. (2) From the nature of the case, Baptism,
        being a new <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">birth</span></em>, is absolutely necessary for
        all who are to live the new spiritual life; and as many as are born,
        must be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">born again</span></em> in order to live the
        higher life; but the Blessed Eucharist is not the introduction to a
        new life, but a means of nourishing the life already acquired. Hence
        for children who have already acquired that spiritual life in
        Baptism, and cannot lose it because incapable of sinning, the Blessed
        Eucharist cannot be necessary to salvation, nor even for adults can
        it be absolutely necessary as a means, if there be, as there are,
        other means of retaining the life already acquired.</p><a name=

        meaning here what it ordinarily means when followed by the

        rather be: As the living Father hath sent Me, and I live <em class=

        will then be easier to believe My doctrine, seeing I am Divine; and
        you shall at the same time understand, that it is not in a bloody
        manner (as you suppose) that you are to eat My body. Thus He would
        correct their too carnal interpretation of His words, and point at
        the same time to a reason why the true sense, however difficult, was
        to be accepted. Others think that Christ's words increase the
        difficulty, the sense being, if you are scandalized now, because I
        say, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">while

        will you be scandalized when you see that body taken away into
        heaven, and are yet asked to believe that it is to be eaten on earth?
        It is argued in favour of this opinion, that the form of Christ's
        reply: <span class="tei tei-q">“Does this scandalize you? If
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The spirit</span></span>
        is the spirit of man elevated and ennobled by grace; <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the flesh</span></span>,
        the corrupt dispositions and weak thoughts of human nature unaided by
        grace (see Rom. viii. 5, 6); and the meaning of the verse is; it is
        the mind illumined by grace that quickeneth to faith and to a proper
        understanding of My words; the mind or human nature by itself is of
        no avail in such matters; the words which I have spoken to you are
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to be
        understood by</span></em> the mind quickened and illumined by grace.
        So St. Chrys., Teoph., Wisem., Perr., M'Ev. But there are serious
        difficulties against this view—(1) <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“caro”</span> is then taken metaphorically in this verse,
        while throughout the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg
        131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        context it has been taken literally of the flesh of Christ; (2) the
        explanation of the words <span class="tei tei-q">“are spirit and
        life”</span> is unnatural.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) Others take
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the
        Spirit</span></span> of the Divinity of Christ, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">the flesh</span></span>
        of His humanity considered apart from the Divinity; and the meaning
        of the verse then is: it is My Divinity that quickeneth, and maketh
        My flesh a meat enduring unto eternal life; the flesh if separated
        from the Divinity would profit nothing; the words which I have spoken
        to you regard My life-giving Divinity as united to My humanity. In
        this view, as Mald. explains it, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“life,”</span> by a Hebraism, is equivalent to an
        adjective signifying <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">life-giving</span></em>, as may be inferred from
        the beginning of the verse, where it is said that it is the Spirit
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that giveth
        life</span></em>.<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href=
        "#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a> Hence
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirit and life”</span> is equivalent to
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">life-giving</span></em> Spirit, and the latter
        part of the verse means that Christ's words have reference to His
        life-giving Divinity in union with His humanity. So, too, St. Cyril
        of Alex., Beel., Corl. We prefer this view, and hold that Christ here
        gives the key to the solution of the difficulty on account of which
        His disciples had murmured (verse 62). He had closed His discourse
        with words attributing eternal life to the eating of His flesh (verse
        59); they murmured accordingly, thinking it absurd or incredible that
        such effect could follow from such a cause as the eating of a man's
        flesh; and in verse 64 He explains that His flesh is the flesh of the
        Man-God, which therefore through the quickening influence of the
        Divinity with which it is united, is capable of producing such
        marvellous effects.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is not a
        shadow of probability in the interpretation put upon this verse by
        the Sacramentarians. They explained the verse to mean: that the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">figurative</span></em> sense of what He had said
        regarding the necessity of eating His flesh and blood profits, but
        that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">literal</span></em> sense would profit nothing.
        Thus they professed to find in these words an assurance that Christ
        had not spoken of a real eating of His flesh in the Eucharist, but
        only of a spiritual reception of Himself through faith. In reply to
        this we say—(1) that throughout the rest of the Bible <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“spiritus”</span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“caro”</span> are not even once used of a figurative and
        literal sense; (2) if <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg
        132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Christ here gave the explanation which our adversaries suppose, how
        is it that, as we learn from verse 67, many of His disciples retired
        notwithstanding, and walked with Him no more? In such an explanation
        all their difficulty would be removed, and they would be taught that
        it was only of a figurative eating by faith that Christ had been
        speaking. How then account for their departure? But it was different
        in the explanation we have given above. In our view, Christ, still
        insisting on a real reception of His flesh, merely explains how it is
        that such real reception can lead to such glorious results.</p>

        your difficulty (verse 65). To indicate Christ's Divine knowledge,

        which is substantially the same as what is said here, since to be
        drawn to Christ by the Father is nothing else than to be given grace
        by the Father to come to Christ. It might seem at first sight that
        these words excuse the incredulity of those whom Christ addresses;
        but it is not so. For, the reason they had not been drawn by the
        Father was because they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        replies for all the Apostles (not knowing the unbelief of Judas), and
        confesses the truth of Christ's doctrine, and, according to the

        however, whether the Vulgate reading here is correct. The oldest

        a full confession of Christ's Divinity, or only that He was the
        Messias, it is difficult to say. It would seem indeed from the praise
        bestowed upon Peter by our Lord (Matt. xvi. 16) on an occasion
        subsequent to this, that then for the first time Peter fully

        <span class="tei tei-q">“fratres”</span> (ἀδελφοὶ) is used in the
        Sacred Scriptures of many who are not children of the same parents.
        Thus it is used of fellow-countrymen, Rom. ix. 3, 4; (2) of
        co-religionists, Rom. i. 13; (3) of relations who were not, however,
        members of the same family, Gen. xiii. 8, xiv. 4. In these verses of
        Genesis, Abraham and Lot are referred to as <em class=

        there need be no difficulty about admitting that the faith of the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">8-10. Christ here
        seems to say that He will not go up to Jerusalem for the feast, and
        yet He went. Various answers to this difficulty have been given:—(1)
        Many ancient MSS. and versions, instead of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Non (οὐκ) ascendo”</span> read <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, I go not up <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yet</span></em>.
        However, as this is the easier reading to explain, and as the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138"
        id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> other is equally well
        supported by ancient authority, we are inclined to believe that the
        more difficult (οὐκ) is the true reading. Hence (2) others say that
        our Lord used an ambiguous phrase: I go not up, meaning I go not up
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">now</span></em> (but shall go afterwards). (3)
        The correct explanation seems to be that insinuated by our
        Evangelist. Christ said: I go not up (as you desire, in your company,
        and publicly); then when He went up, it was not publicly, but, as it
        were, in secret.</p>

        with what follows. The sense is: it was on this account Moses gave
        you circumcision; namely, because it had been handed down from the
        Patriarchs (Gen. xvii. 10), not because it was properly a part of the
        law. If then a man may receive circumcision on the Sabbath,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and

        this explanation, <span class="tei tei-q">“ut”</span> (ἵνα) is
        ecbatic, denoting a consequence. See Gen. xxii. 14; John <a href=

        afterwards addressed to the Apostles (xiii. 33), it is not likely
        that the reference is to seeking Him at the destruction of Jerusalem,
        for the Apostles did not seek Him then. It would also seem from xiii.
        33 that the view of Maldonatus just stated is not probable, for in
        xiii. 33 there is not a conditional statement, but simply a
        prediction that the Apostles would seek Him. Hence we take it that in
        the text before us also, there is a prediction that the Jews after
        His departure would, when in distress and tribulation, desire to see
        Him once more among them. Doubtless, many Jews afterwards had such a
        desire, but it was in vain, for He had gone to Him that sent Him.</p>

        the separation would be complete, for He would be no longer here, and
        where He would be they could not join Him. Some take the words:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“You cannot come,”</span> as meaning here

        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">For as yet the Spirit was
        not given</span></span>. These words explain why our Lord spoke of
        the abundant outpouring of the Spirit as <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">still to
        come</span></em>, for the Holy Ghost was not yet given, inasmuch as
        Christ was not yet glorified (xvi. 7). When it is said that the Holy
        Ghost was not yet given, the meaning is, that He was not yet given so
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">abundantly</span></em>, so <em class=

        the first Pentecost. It is not meant that the Holy Ghost had not been

        their souls; moreover, according to the common teaching of the
        fathers and theologians, they, like the just now, had the Holy Ghost
        united to their souls, not merely by His grace, but also by a
        substantial union. This union is not, however, peculiar to the Holy
        Ghost, but is common to the Three Divine Persons, by reason of their
        unity of nature, and is only by appropriation attributed to the Holy
        Ghost. See Franz., <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            of the adulteress harmonizes beautifully with His declaration
            immediately after (viii. 15), that at His first coming He
            condemned no man. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            found its way into so many MSS., unless it was written by St.
            John. On the other hand, it is easy to see how, though genuine,
            it came to be omitted in many MSS., through the fear that
            Christ's merciful treatment of the adulteress might encourage
            sinners. This is exactly what St. Augustine says:—<span class=

            explains the absence of the passage in so many MSS., versions,
            and fathers. As to the internal arguments against the passage, it
            must be admitted that a number of words are used here which are
            not met with elsewhere in the writings of St. John; but then the
            subject is peculiar, and besides in many other passages which

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the
            evidence, which has been impartially laid before the reader, we
            hold we are justified in concluding that even on mere critical
            grounds the passage is more probably genuine. Some, as Franzelin
            (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
            Sacra. Script.</span></span>, Thes. xix., pp. 466, 467), go
            farther, and hold, that since the decree of the Council of Trent
            (Sess. iv.), which defined all the sacred books of the Bible, and
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all
            their parts</span></em>, as found in the Latin Vulgate, to be
            canonical, it is not lawful for any Catholic to question the
            authenticity of this passage. They argue that this passage
            constitutes a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">part</span></em> (not merely a <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“particula”</span>) of the Gospel of St. John, and
            is, therefore, covered by the decree of Trent. Nor can it be said
            in reply that the Council, in the words <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“cum omnibus suis partibus,”</span> meant to define
            the authenticity of the Deuterocanonical fragments of the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Old</span></em> Testament only, for the

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a> of
            the Council show that these words were intended to refer
            especially to the fragments of the Gospels.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To conclude,
            then, we hold that we are not only critically justified in
            accepting John vii. 53-viii. 11, as authentic, but that it is
            extremely probable that as Catholics we are <em class=

          He mean to go into the depths of hell, where we the children of
          Abraham cannot, of course, follow Him? But the more simple
          explanation is: He cannot escape from us wherever He may go on this

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">25. This is a
          very obscure verse. Christ had just spoken of faith in Himself; but
          in Himself <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">under what aspect</span></em> He had not
          defined; and now in the hope of evoking an answer for which they
          could punish Him, they ask: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-weight: 700">Who art thou?</span></span> His answer is
          purposely obscure. It is according to the Greek text, τὴν ἀρχὴν ὅτι
          (or ὅ τι) καὶ λαλῶ ὑμῖν; which is rendered in the Vulgate:
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principium qui et loquor vobis</span></span>,
          and in our Rheims version: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-weight: 700">The beginning, who also speak unto
          you</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About the
          meaning of this answer there is a great diversity opinion. Some
          take the words affirmatively, others interrogatively; some
          understand τὴν ἀρχήν as a substantive, others as an adverb; some
          regard ὅ τι as a relative (that which), others as an interrogative
          = τί (how or why?) and others again as a conjunction, ὅτι (for, or,
          because). The Vulgate translator may have read ὅστις (who) instead
          of ὅ τι, or ὅτι; or possibly <span class="tei tei-q">“Qui
          et”</span> of our Vulgate is a corruption of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“quia,”</span> which is found in the oldest Vulgate
          MSS. The objection against the Vulgate and English translations is
          that while τῆν ἀρχήν is an accusative, they <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seem</span></em> to
          understand it as a nominative. Nor can it be replied, that it is
          attracted into the accusative case of the relative which follows;
          for, apart from the fact that there is no other instance of such
          attraction in St. John, the explanation is inadmissible here,
          inasmuch as these translations understand the relative not as an
          accusative, but as a nominative. A better defence is that of St.
          Augustine, who would supply some such words as: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Believe Me to be,”</span> before the sentence, thus
          making <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">principium</span></span> the
          accusative after <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg
          156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">esse</span></span>: Believe Me to be the
          beginning, &amp;c.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) Others,
          understanding τὴν ἀρχήν in the same way as the preceding opinion,
          take ὁ τι as a relative, and render: I am the beginning, that which
          I also declare unto you. Here there is room for attraction, since
          the relative is now taken as an accusative; but against such
          attraction is the usage of St. John, as already stated.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) Others,
          taking τὴν ἀρχήν as an adverb (from the beginning), render: I am
          from the beginning, from eternity, what I even declare unto you.
          But it is objected to this view that τὴν ἀρχήν is not found
          elsewhere in Sacred Scripture in this sense, and moreover that the
          verb λαλῶ (to discuss with, to converse) is wrongly taken to be
          equivalent to λέγω (to declare). To this latter point, however, it
          is replied that the two verbs are frequently interchanged in later
          Greek.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) Others thus:
          Even that which I have also spoken to you from the beginning.<a id=
          "noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href="#note_68"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a> But
          this view is open to the same objections as the preceding.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(5) Others
          again: Essentially (or, in very deed) that which I speak unto you.
          So Alford.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(6) Others: On
          the whole, why do I even speak with you? So St. Chrys., Corluy,
          &amp;c.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(7) Others:
          Absolutely, or most certainly, that which I also tell you. So
          Beel., Kuin, &amp;c. Τὴν ἀρχήν is thus taken as equivalent to
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">omnino</span></span>, for which sense Beelen
          quotes several classical writers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We prefer the
          sixth and seventh opinions; but rather the seventh, since it
          supposes Christ to answer their question, though in language
          purposely obscure. In the sixth opinion, Christ vouchsafes no
          answer to their question, and we should naturally expect an
          impatient interruption from them immediately after, were that
          opinion correct.</p>

          here is not the eternal existence of the Son, nor the day of His
          death, nor Himself, the day-star of justice, but the day for which
          all the ancient just had so long prayed and sighed: <span class=

          "font-style: italic">drop down dew, ye heavens, from above, and let
          the clouds rain the just</span></span>”</span> (Is. xlv. 8), the
          day or time of Christ's mortal life on earth. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Rejoiced that he might
          see</span></span> (ἵνα ἴδη). Most probably the meaning is, that
          Abraham, after God had revealed to him that the Messias was to be
          born of his seed, hoped and yearned in joyful confidence that he
          might see Christ on earth. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-weight: 700">He saw it, and was glad.</span></span> It would
          seem from these words that Abraham saw in the way in which he had
          yearned to see. And since he cannot have yearned to see Christ's
          day merely by faith, for he already saw it by faith; hence there
          must be question here of some other vision. Mald., A Lap., and most
          commentators hold that Abraham's mental vision was elevated by God,
          so that from limbo he saw and knew that Christ was on earth just as
          the angels and saints in heaven know what happens on earth and in
          hell. The aorist tenses in the Greek (εἶδεν καὶ ἐχάρη), with their
          past definite signification, are not easily reconciled with this
          view, and hence others prefer to suppose that there is reference to
          some very special revelation made to Abraham during his life on
          earth, in which he saw with something more than the vision of
          ordinary faith the time and various circumstances of Christ's
          mortal life (compare Heb. xi. 13).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. Some think that
        the events about to be narrated occurred shortly after Christ left
        the temple (viii. 59) and had been rejoined by His disciples, who are
        supposed to have left when He disappeared. This view seems to us more
        probable than that which places the events about to be narrated on a
        different day from those referred to in the close of the preceding
        chapter. When we are told that Jesus went out of the temple (viii.
        59), and passing by, saw a man blind from his birth, the natural
        inference is, that the Evangelist is speaking of Christ's passing
        along after He left the temple. This view is confirmed too by the
        fact, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">Jesus</span></span> should not be read in this
        verse, being spurious according to all critics, but must be supplied
        from the preceding chapter.</p>

        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">blind from

        striking.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. How the
        disciples knew the man had been <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        excite greater compassion, and probably to obtain alms, he may have
        been himself proclaiming the fact. It was reasonable enough that the
        disciples should think of the sins of the man's parents as the reason
        why he was born blind, for God Himself tells us that He is
        <span class="tei tei-q">“jealous, visiting the iniquities of the
        fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
        generation”</span> (Exod. xx. 5). And we know that David was punished
        by the death of his child (2 Kings xii. 14). But why should the
        disciples imagine that the man might have been born blind on account
        of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his
        own</span></em> sins? Some think that the disciples may have been
        imbued with the false notions of the Jews regarding the
        transmigration of souls, and have thought that this man's soul had
        sinned in some previous state of existence, and been therefore
        imprisoned in a blind body. But it is unlikely that the disciples at
        this time, the third year of our Lord's public life, were still in
        such ignorance.<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href=

        think that the question means: was he born blind for some sin which

        was hastily put without advertence to its absurdity. Others that the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">7. St. John
        interprets for his readers the Hebrew name (שׂלוח) of the pool. Some
        have regarded the interpretation as the gloss of a copyist or
        interpreter; but there is practically no authority for doubting that
        it was written by St. John. Doubtless the pool bore this name for
        some mystic reason; by the natural salubrity of its waters, or by a
        supernatural virtue, like Bethesda (v. 2), it may have typified
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Him who was

        its old name <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        undisputed sites at Jerusalem. St. Jerome speaks of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the spring which supplied it as situated
        at the foot of Mount Sion, and mentions also the intermittent
        character of the spring. See Isaiah viii. 6. In another place St.
        Jerome speaks of Siloe as situated at <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        foot of Mount Moria,”</span> so that there is no reason for doubting
        that the pool was situated in the valley called Tyropaeon, which
        separated Mount Sion from Mount Moria, just where <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Birket
        Silwan</span></span> is still to be seen. See also Josephus,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bella
        Jud.</span></span>, v. 4. 1. The blind man journeying towards the
        pool, with clay upon his eyes, must have attracted the attention of
        many, and thus helped to make the miracle more public. That one born
        blind, and accustomed to move about Jerusalem, would be able to find
        his way to the pool, there is no reason to doubt; in any case there
        need be no difficulty raised on this point, as he could probably have
        readily found some one willing to guide him.</p>

        rather to be rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“Sir.”</span> It is a
        term of respect, but does not at all imply that the man already
        recognised Christ to be his Lord and God, as is clear from the

        two senses—bodily and spiritual—and Christ, as the occasion naturally
        suggested, now goes on to speak of spiritual blindness. Christ's
        words here are not contradictory of iii. 17 or viii. 15, because here
        there is question of a different judgment. In those passages there is
        question of the judgment of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">condemnation</span></em>, for which Christ did
        not come at His first coming; here there is question of the judgment
        of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">discernment</span></em> (κρίμα, not κρίσις), and
        for this He had come at His first coming. The sense of the present
        passage then is: I am come to separate the good from the bad; to make
        known who love God, and who do not; to show and to effect that those
        who have been regarded as spiritually blind, and who, indeed, in many
        cases, have been so, may have the eyes of their souls opened to the
        light of truth, while those who have been thought, and who think
        themselves, to see (such as you Pharisees), may be shown to be indeed
        spiritually blind, and may really <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">become more
        blind</span></em>, by being involved in deeper darkness through their
        own unbelief. This latter effect—that they should become more
        blind—was not directly intended by Christ, but it was foreseen and
        permitted, and this is enough to justify Christ's expression:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“That they who see may become <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. This verse and
        those that follow down to the end of verse 18, are a continuation of
        the discourse directed to the Pharisees, and begun in ix. 39, with
        which verse this tenth chapter might more correctly have been
        commenced. The logical connection of the following parable with the
        close of the preceding chapter is not clear. Some, as St. Aug., say
        that Christ is proving that the Pharisees were <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">blind</span></em>,
        else they would recognise Him as the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">door</span></em>
        through which the true fold must be entered, and as the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true
        Shepherd</span></em>. Others, as St. Chrys., think that He is
        replying to a tacit objection of the Pharisees, to the effect that
        they refused to recognise Him, not because they were blind, but
        because He was an impostor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The parable, taken
        strictly, is a narrative of a probable but fictitious <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">event</span></em>,
        like that relating to the Prodigal Son (Luke xv. 11-32). Where, as
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177"
        id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the present instance, there
        is continued or prolonged metaphor, without the description of any
        event, some would call it an allegory and not a parable; but we
        prefer not to interfere with a phrase so familiar as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the parable of the good Shepherd.”</span> It will be
        noted that we speak of parables, and not merely of one parable, for
        we hold that the parable of Christ as <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">door</span></em> of
        the fold is distinct from that of Christ as Shepherd. Our reasons for
        this will appear as we proceed. To understand the grammatical sense
        of these two parables, we must bear in mind what were the relations
        of the shepherd to his sheep in eastern countries, and especially in
        Palestine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Spring of
        the year the Jewish shepherd conducted his sheep to their pasture,
        and there they remained until the end of the following Autumn. At
        night they were enclosed in folds, the flocks of several shepherds
        being sometimes gathered in the same fold. The fold, open overhead,
        was surrounded by a wall, in which there was but one door, at which
        the doorkeeper (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">ostiarius</span></span>)
        remained through the night, until the shepherd's return in the
        morning. A thief, wishing to steal sheep, would, of course, not
        attempt to enter by the door, but would climb the wall. On the
        shepherd's return in the morning the door of the fold was thrown open
        by the doorkeeper, and each shepherd entered and called his own
        sheep, which, knowing his voice, followed him to their own pasture.
        Throughout the whole day the shepherd remained with them, guarding
        them from wild beasts and robbers, and attending to the weak and
        maimed. Thus his relations with his sheep were very close and
        constant indeed, and must be carefully borne in mind, in order that
        we may rightly appreciate the full significance of these beautiful
        parables.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">He that entereth not by
        the door into the sheepfold.</span></span> If we strip this language
        of its metaphorical character, the sense is: that the teacher who
        enters not into the Church through Christ as the door, that is to
        say, by believing in Christ, is a false teacher, as were therefore,
        the Scribes and Pharisees. Christ, then, is the door (see verse
        <a href="#X_7" class="tei tei-ref">7</a>); the Church is the
        sheepfold; and the Scribes and Pharisees, with all such, are the
        thieves and robbers who injure their fellow-men, sometimes secretly
        like <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name=
        "Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> thieves, sometimes
        with open violence like robbers. That Christ is signified by
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the door,”</span> is the view of SS. Aug.,
        Cyril, Bede, Greg., and of A Lap.; and is, indeed, distinctly stated
        by Himself, in verse 7, after His hearers had failed to understand
        His words. Hence we unhesitatingly reject the view of Mald. and many
        others, who take <span class="tei tei-q">“the door”</span> in verse 1
        to be different from that in verse 7; the latter, they say, being the
        door of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sheep</span></em>, Christ Himself; the former
        the door of the shepherds, which Mald. understands of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">legitimate
        authority</span></em> to teach. We have no doubt that the door in
        both verses is the same, because Christ begins to explain, in verse
        7: <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">therefore</span></em>
        said to them again”</span> what He had said in verses 1-5.</p>

        all points between the two things which are implicitly compared. If
        we say Patrick is a lion, we mean that he has courage or strength;
        but we do not mean that he has four legs. Similarly, though the
        Church is compared to a sheepfold, it does not follow that because
        the sheep had to be led outside the fold in order to find pasture,
        that therefore the faithful must be <span class=

        Church</span></span> before they can obtain the spiritual food of
        their souls. No, the Church is a fold which has its pastures within
        itself; and what Christ here declares is that a good pastor does for
        the faithful what the shepherd does for the sheep when he leads them
        forth; namely, he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg

        referred to His death for men, Christ goes on to speak of the call of
        the Gentiles, thereby indicating the efficacy of His sacrifice for
        all, whether Jews or Gentiles. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        fold.</span></span> The other sheep were those Gentiles who were
        outside the Jewish Church, but were to be brought within the Church
        of Christ, so that there might be one fold (rather <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">flock</span></em>),
        and one shepherd. Strictly speaking, the Gentiles except very few
        were not yet His sheep, but those who were to obey the call are
        spoken of as such by anticipation, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class=

        that they should be efficaciously called to the faith. <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">And there shall be one

        fold,”</span> or rather <span class="tei tei-q">“one flock”</span>
        (ποίμνη), distinctly implies the unity of Christ's Church, and the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“one shepherd,”</span> is Jesus Christ
        Himself as invisible head, with the Pope His representative as
        visible head.<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href=
        "#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> We have
        therefore three very important declarations in this verse. (1) The
        faith was to be preached to the Gentiles; (2) Christ was to have but
        one flock composed alike of Jews and Gentiles; (3) that one flock was
        to have one supreme visible head. Some, like Mald., think that the
        expression <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>
        fold”</span> implies that there was another fold, that is to say,
        those who were to be called from among the Gentiles. But this does
        not necessarily follow, as the contrast may be, and we believe is,
        not between a fold of the Jews and a fold of the Gentiles, but
        between the fold of the Jewish Church which excluded the Gentiles,
        and the fold of the Christian Church which was to include
        them.</p><a name="X_17" id="X_17" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">freely</span></em>. But a difficulty here
        presents itself. How was He free in laying down His life, if, as He
        declares, in the end of this same verse, He had a command from His
        Father to do so? Surely He was bound not to disobey that command, and
        thus bound to die, and so not free in dying? The difficulty then is
        to reconcile Christ's freedom in dying with the Father's command that
        He should die. Many answers have been given.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) The command of
        the Father was not really a command <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> or precept, but only a wish, with which Christ,
        without sinning, was free not to correspond. But this answer is
        commonly rejected by commentators and theologians, who hold that
        there was a strict command. Hence:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) Christ was
        commanded to redeem man, but not to die. He could have redeemed us in
        many other ways; therefore in choosing death as the way, He died
        freely. But it is replied to this that St. Paul tells us that Christ
        was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">obedient even unto death</span></span> (Phil.
        ii. 8), thereby implying that His death was commanded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) Christ was
        commanded to die, but was left free as to the manner and
        circumstances of His death, and therefore was free as to the actual
        death He underwent upon the cross. But it is again replied that St.
        Paul declares <span class="tei tei-q">“He was obedient unto death,
        even the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">death of the cross</span></span>”</span> (Phil.
        ii. 8).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) De Lugo and
        others hold that Christ's freedom in dying consisted in the fact that
        He could have asked and obtained a dispensation from His Father. He
        freely chose not to ask a dispensation; therefore He died freely.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(5) Franzelin
        inclines to the view that the will of the Father was merely a
        <span class="tei tei-q">“beneplacitum,”</span> a wish, until Christ
        freely accepted it, when it became a command: consequent, however,
        upon Christ's free acceptance. Thus, in virtue of this free
        acceptance, Christ died freely, though having a command from His
        Father that He should die.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(6) Lastly, there
        is the opinion of Suarez, who explains thus: Christ's human will had,
        strictly speaking, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">power</span></em> of resisting the will of God,
        and of sinning, and was therefore free: consequently, His human will
        was free in accepting the command to die, because, strictly speaking,
        it had the power to resist. No doubt this power could never be
        reduced to act in our Divine Lord, for the Second Divine Person, in
        virtue of its hypostatic union with Christ's humanity, was bound to
        preserve His human will from sin by the operation of grace.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“On account of this perpetual watchfulness on the part of
        the Second Divine Person,”</span> says A Lap., who adopts this
        opinion, <span class="tei tei-q">“the humanity of Christ is said to
        be extrinsically impeccable; not that the Divinity took away the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">power</span></em> <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of sinning (non quod Verbum illam (humanitatem)
        praedeterminaret), but that it always supplied the grace, under the
        influence of which it was foreseen that Christ's human will would
        freely fulfil each precept.”</span> This view we prefer; and hence we
        hold—(1) that Christ had a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">strict command</span></em> from His Father to
        die; (2) that His human will had the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">power</span></em> to
        disobey this command, and was consequently free in accepting death;
        (3) that the Second Divine Person provided that this power to disobey
        could <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never
        be reduced to act</span></em>, and hence Christ was always
        extrinsically impeccable.</p>

        the Feast of Tabernacles (vii. 2). Now the Evangelist suddenly passes
        on to the Feast of Purification. During the period of more than two
        months that intervened (see above on v. <a href="#X_1" class=

        22); or, as Patrizzi holds, spent his time in the country parts of
        Judea, away from Jerusalem. The Feast of the Dedication instituted by
        Judas Maccabeus, about 165 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        cleansing of the temple and dedication of the altar of holocausts

        part of our November and the first part of December. See 1 Mach. iv.

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">35, 36. While all
        Catholic commentators and theologians contend that Christ does not in
        these two verses withdraw His claim to true Divinity, yet they differ
        as to the sense of His reply, and hence as to the interpretation of
        the verses.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) Some, as
        Franzelin, hold that Christ here proves both that He is God, and that
        He has a right to call Himself God. The argument then is according to
        these: if your judges could be called gods, <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> even in an improper sense, how much more
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the
        strictest sense</span></em> can He be called and is He God, whom the
        Father generated <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">holy with His own holiness</span></em>, and sent
        into the world?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) Others, as
        Maran, Jungmann, &amp;c., explain the argument here from the context
        in the 81st Psalm. Christ, they say, reasons thus. If men could be
        called gods, as they are in Sacred Scripture (and the Sacred
        Scripture cannot be gainsaid), how much more, in a strict sense, can
        He be called God, and is He God, whom the same Scriptures address in
        the 8th verse of the same 81st Psalm: <span class="tei tei-q">“Arise,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">O
        God</span></em>, judge Thou the earth, for Thou shalt inherit among
        the nations”</span>?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) Others hold
        that Christ in these two verses does not insist upon the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature</span></em> of
        His Sonship, but contents Himself with showing that He has a right to
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">call</span></em> Himself God; then in the
        following verses He shows that He is God in the strictest sense. In
        this view Christ prescinds in these verses from the sense in which He
        is God, and shows that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">in some sense</span></em>, as the legate of the
        Father, He has a right to be called God. This was sufficient for the
        moment to shut the mouths of His adversaries. Whether He is God in
        the truest and strictest sense, or only in an improper sense, He does
        not here insist, though His language shows that even in these verses
        He speaks of Himself as truly God. For the argument shows that in
        concluding, in verse 36, that He has a right to call Himself
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of God,”</span> He means to justify his
        original statement: <span class="tei tei-q">“I and the Father are
        one”</span> (verse 30); but these statements are synonymous, and the
        one justifies the other only when there is question of natural
        Sonship. No merely adopted son of God could say that He is one with
        the Father.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Any of these
        answers solves the objection drawn from these verses against Christ's
        Divinity; but we prefer the last, and hold, therefore, that Christ
        first proves against the Pharisees that He has a right to <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">call</span></em>
        Himself God, and then goes on to show in what sense He is
        God.</p><a name="X_37" id="X_37" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. The Greek
        aorist (ἡ ἀλέιψασα) shows that the reference is to some unction that
        had already taken place, and not to that which happened subsequently,
        and which is narrated by our Evangelist (xii. 3; Matt. xxvi. 7; Mark
        xiv. 3). The unction here referred to we take to be that recorded by
        St. Luke (vii. 37, 38); and hence, notwithstanding their apparently
        different characters, we regard Mary the sister of Lazarus (xi. 2) as
        identical with <span class="tei tei-q">“the woman who was a sinner in
        the city”</span> (Luke vii. 37). For St. John in the words:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Mary was she that anointed the Lord,”</span>
        &amp;c., certainly seems to speak of an unction already known to his
        readers, and the only unction of Christ, as far as is known, that had
        taken place before this illness of Lazarus, is that recorded by St.
        Luke in the passage referred to. In this view, then, our Lord was
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">twice</span></em> anointed by a woman; on the
        first occasion in the house of Simon the Pharisee (Luke vii. 40, 46),
        probably in Galilee (see Luke vii. 11), as recorded by St. Luke vii.
        37, 38; on the second occasion at Bethania, in Judea, in the house of
        Simon the leper (Matt. xxvi. 6), as recorded by Matthew, Mark, and
        John (J. xii. 3). As the present verse proves that Mary, the sister
        of Lazarus, had already anointed our Lord: and as John xii. 3, with
        its context, proves that the same sister of Lazarus again anointed
        Him on a subsequent occasion, we hold that the only woman referred to
        in the Gospels as having anointed the living body of our Lord, is
        Mary, the sister of Lazarus; and that she did so on <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em>
        different occasions. Thus, as already stated, we identify Luke's
        <span class="tei tei-q">“sinner in the city”</span> with the sister
        of Lazarus. If it be objected that the contemplative character of the
        sister of Lazarus (Luke x. 38-42), and the close friendship of Jesus
        with her and her family (John xi. 3, 5), forbid us to regard her as
        identical with the woman who had once been <span class="tei tei-q">“a
        sinner in the city,”</span> we reply that Mary, converted in the
        beginning of our Lord's public life, had now for some years led an
        edifying life of penance. As a sinner she had lived in some city of
        Galilee, far away from home, whither she may have gone with some
        lover whom she met at Jerusalem at one of the great festivals; now
        she lived with her brother at <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Bethania, in Judea, where possibly her former
        sinful life may have been unknown, so that there was no danger of
        scandal in Christ's friendship with herself and her family. To those
        who, like Steenkiste (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Comm. on Matt. Quaes.</span></span> 678,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">conclusio</span></span>), have <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“a deep-rooted repugnance”</span> to believing that the
        sister of Lazarus had ever been a public sinner, we would recall the
        fact that there are many sinners in heaven to-day enjoying the
        society of God after a far shorter penance than we require to suppose
        in the case of the sister of Lazarus, before she began to enjoy the
        friendship of Christ. Our Divine Lord's tenderness and mercy towards
        sinners are written on every page of the Gospels, and the only real
        difficulty here is that to which we have already replied, arising
        from the danger of scandal, through our Lord's associating with such
        a woman.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus far we have
        spoken only of <span class="tei tei-q">“the sinner,”</span> and the
        sister of Lazarus; but there is a further question, whether Mary
        Magdalen (Luke viii. 2; Matt. xxvii. 56, 61; Matt. xxviii. 1; John
        xx. 1, &amp;c.) and they are all three, one and the same person. We
        believe it to be more probable that they are. The more common opinion
        among the fathers identifies the three; from the sixth till the
        seventeenth century their identity was unquestioned in the Western
        Church; and our Roman Breviary and Missal still identify them on the
        Feast of St. Mary Magdalen, the 22nd of July. So, too, Tertull.,
        Gregory the Great, Mald., Natal-Alex., Mauduit, M'Ev., Corluy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have stated
        what we consider the most probable view—that Christ was twice
        anointed during His public life, and on both occasions by the same
        person, the sister of Lazarus, who is identical with <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the sinner”</span> and Magdalen. It is right, however,
        that we should add, that there is great diversity of opinion, even
        among Catholic commentators. Some have held that there were three
        different unctions, others that there was only one. Some have held
        that the sister of Lazarus, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        sinner,”</span> and Magdalen are all three distinct; others, that at
        least the sister of Lazarus and the sinner are distinct; and among
        those who will not admit the identity of all three are found such
        able commentators as St. Chrys., Estius, Calmet, Beelen. In such a
        case, where the Scriptures are obscure, where the fathers disagree,
        where commentators are so divided, and the Greek Church, which
        celebrates three different feasts <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class=

        say <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">seems</span></em>, because the different feasts
        might possibly be celebrated in honour of the same woman) to differ
        from the Latin, it is hard to attain to anything more than
        probability, and we have set forth above what, after a very careful
        examination of the whole question, seems to us most probable. See

        this verse with what has gone before, as giving the reason why the
        sisters of Lazarus informed Jesus of the illness of His friend. But
        it is better to connect with what follows in this way. Jesus loved
        Lazarus, and therefore when He had remained in the same place two
        days, then He said: Let us go into Judea again, as if He were unable
        to remain any longer away from His friend. Thus it is not merely His
        return to Judea, but His return after two days, that proves His
        friendship. Had He returned sooner, the miracle of the raising of
        Lazarus would have been less striking, and would not have afforded to
        Martha and Mary such a powerful <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        here of a friendship that must have been the result of long and
        intimate intercourse shows us how incomplete are the Gospel records.
        It is very interesting to notice how in this verse St. John refers to
        the love of Jesus for Lazarus and his sisters by a different word
        from that used by the sisters in verse 3. Instead of φιλεῖς, which
        expresses the affection of personal attachment, St. John, now that
        there is question of the love of Jesus not only for Lazarus but also
        for his sisters, uses Ἠγάπα, which expresses rather esteem than love,
        rather a reasoning appreciation than a heartfelt attachment. See

        that Lazarus will start at His call. Jesus did not enter the
        sepulchre; if He had entered, our Evangelist who records all the
        circumstances so minutely would have mentioned the fact. It is hardly
        necessary to remark upon the absurd explanation of Paulus and Gabler,
        to the effect that Jesus alone looked into the sepulchre, or alone
        entered it, and to His surprise found Lazarus alive; that He then
        returned thanks to God that Lazarus was not dead, and told Lazarus to
        come out of the sepulchre. For that Christ did not enter the

        from His words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Come forth,”</span> which
        imply that He was outside. That He alone looked into the sepulchre,
        is incredible; for we may be sure that the natural curiosity of the
        crowd assembled, led many of them to look into the sepulchre. Is it
        likely too, that if Jesus on looking into the sepulchre saw His
        friend alive, He would coolly begin to return thanks to God, and then
        quietly tell Lazarus to come out? He should have been more than man,

        In other words, Jesus wished to make the raising of Lazarus a clear
        proof of His Divinity, by thus calling God to witness to the miracle
        before it was wrought. Unquestionably the raising of Lazarus from the
        dead is a most powerful proof of the Divinity of Christ. It was a
        manifest and public miracle performed in the presence of a whole
        crowd of witnesses (see <a href="#XI_19" class="tei tei-ref">19</a>,
        <a href="#XI_27" class="tei tei-ref">31</a>, <a href="#XI_43" class=
        "tei tei-ref">45</a>), performed to prove that Christ had come from
        the Father (verse <a href="#XI_42" class="tei tei-ref">42</a>); that
        He was the resurrection and the life (verses <a href="#XI_25" class=
        "tei tei-ref">25, 26</a>); that He was the Son of God (verse <a href=
        "#XI_4" class="tei tei-ref">4</a>); that, in fact, He was all that
        which, a short <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg
        203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        time previously, and in Jerusalem itself, He had claimed to be,
        namely, the Lord of life, one with the Father (x. <a href="#X_28"
        class="tei tei-ref">28</a>, <a href="#X_29" class=
        "tei tei-ref">30</a>). Such a miracle in such circumstances God could
        never have permitted, had Christ not been in truth all that He
        claimed to be.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rationalists have
        tried in various ways to explain away this stupendous miracle. Some
        say that the story is a pure concoction of St. John, else it would
        have been narrated by some other Evangelist. Others, that the death
        of Lazarus was merely feigned, a pious ruse in which Christ and
        Lazarus, as well as Martha and Mary were accomplices, with the object
        of inducing the people to accept and follow the teachings of
        Christ.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But we need hardly
        point out how absurd it is to suppose, that St. John would attempt,
        fifty years after the Synoptic Evangelists, to invent and put forward
        such a minute account of an extraordinary event till then unheard-of
        by the Jews. That the other Evangelists make no mention of this
        stupendous miracle is remarkable, but may be accounted for by the
        fact that prior to the history of the Passion, they confine their
        narratives almost entirely to what Christ said and did in Galilee.
        Hence they do not mention the healing of the man who had been ill for
        thirty-eight years (John <a href="#V_5" class="tei tei-ref">v.
        5-9</a>), nor of the man born blind (John <a href="#Chapter_IX"
        class="tei tei-ref">ix.</a>), nor, for the same reason, the raising
        of Lazarus, all these miracles having occurred in Judea.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second theory
        mentioned above hardly requires refutation. Even His Jewish enemies
        never accused Christ of fraud or deception; and in this particular
        instance the Jews, many of whom were hostile to Jesus (verse 46), and
        no doubt investigated the miracle, had not the slightest suspicion of
        fraud. So certain were all, even the Pharisees, that the miracle was
        genuine, that without attempting to deny it, they merely bethink
        themselves what they will do with Jesus (verses 47,
        48).</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name=

        rid of to save the Jewish nation from incurring the anger of the
        Romans. The Holy Ghost, however, as St. John tells us, signified
        through Caiphas (as an unconscious instrument) that the death of
        Jesus was necessary for the eternal salvation of the Jewish people,
        and of all to be called to the faith who were scattered then or since
        among the Gentiles. Caiphas was unaware of the solemn sense of the
        words which he enunciated; so that the Holy Ghost speaking through a
        prophet may sometimes mean one <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        writers</span></em> did not always understand the meaning of what
        they wrote, and in such cases the sense of Scripture is, of course,
        that which was intended by the Holy Ghost.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Caiphas, whom on
        this occasion the Holy Ghost employed to declare the necessity for
        man of the vicarious sacrifice of Christ, was the Jewish High-priest
        at the time (<a href="#XI_49" class="tei tei-ref">xi. 49</a>,
        <a href="#XVIII_13" class="tei tei-ref">xviii. 13</a>). His
        father-in-law, Annas, is called High-priest by St. Luke (Luke iii. 2;
        Acts iv. 6), from which some, as Beelen, conclude, that each filled
        the office of High-priest every alternate year. For this view,
        however, there is no historical evidence, and it seems more probable
        that Annas is called High-priest by St. Luke, not because he was then
        discharging the duties of the successor of Aaron, but because, having
        been High-priest, and unlawfully deposed (<span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. In Bethania
        then (in the house of Simon the leper, as we learn from Matt. xxvi.
        6; Mark xiv. 3) a supper was prepared for Jesus, at which Lazarus was
        present and Martha served. We take it as certain that Matthew (xxvi.
        6-13) and Mark (xiv. 3-9) refer to the same unction of Christ which
        is recorded by St. John in the following verses here. If not, we
        should have to suppose that the same murmuring for the same cause in
        the same circumstances took place a second time within four days,
        though reprehended by Christ on the first occasion it occurred. That
        SS. Matthew and Mark seem to refer to an occasion <em class=

        explained. The two Synoptic Evangelists record this anointing of
        Jesus by Mary out of its place, and in connection with the treachery
        of Judas, because it was it that finally determined Judas to betray
        our Lord.<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href=

        applied to any box for holding perfumes.</p>

        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">right</span></span> spikenard. The Greek adjective
        thus translated is πιστικῆς, which may mean <em class=

        from πίστις; or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        drink); or, as St. Augustine says, the nard may have been so called
        from the place in which it was obtained. St. John tells us that Mary
        anointed the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">feet</span></em> of our Lord, who, according to
        the Jewish custom, would be reclining on His left side upon a couch,
        with His feet stretching out behind. The first two Evangelists
        mention only the unction of our Lord's head, so that St. John
        supplements their account. The fact that the odour of the ointment
        filled the house, is mentioned as a proof of its excellence. Pliny
        (xiii. 3) refers to such unctions among the Romans: <span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Now there were some that had indignation
        within themselves, and said: Why was this waste of the ointment
        made?”</span> We may admit, then, that some of the others joined
        Judas in murmuring, but probably from a different motive; or, we may
        hold, with some commentators, that the plural is used indefinitely
        for the singular.</p>

        an opportunity of filching some of it for himself. Whether with our

        "tei tei-q">“made away with,”</span> at all events, it is plain from
        the verse, in which Judas is declared a thief, that he sometimes
        appropriated to his own uses money from the common purse. In his

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">7. There is a
        difference of reading in this verse. Many ancient authorities read:
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">She has kept
        it</span></span> (τετήρηκεν) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        the meaning of this reading is plain. The more probable<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> Greek
        reading, however, is: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">That she might keep
        it</span></span> (ἱνα ... τηρήσῃ) <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">against the day of My
        burial</span></span>.”</span> In this reading we take our Lord's
        reply to mean: Let her alone: it was not sold (Judas had asked: Why
        was it not sold?) in order that she might keep it against the day of
        My burial. Thus we would read <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“servaret”</span> instead of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“servet”</span> in the Vulgate; and we take <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“ut”</span> to depend not on <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“sinite,”</span> but on some words such as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“non veniit”</span> (it was not sold) understood. St.
        John's report of Christ's words agrees substantially with that of St.
        Mark, who represents our Lord as saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“She
        is come beforehand to anoint My body for the burial”</span> (Mark
        xiv. 8); and both accounts, as well as that of St. Matt. (xxvi. 12),
        <span class="tei tei-q">“She hath done it for My burial,”</span>
        signify that our Lord's death was so close at hand that this unction
        might be regarded as a preparation for His burial; and hence Mary was
        not to be blamed, inasmuch as such <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> honours were usually paid to bodies before
        burial.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Immediately after
        their account of this unction, SS. Matt. and Mark narrate the compact
        of Judas with the Jews to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver;
        so that it is extremely probable that it was spite at losing the
        price of the ointment used on this occasion that finally determined
        Judas to betray our Lord.</p>

        came to meet our Lord and escort Him into Jerusalem. Hundreds of
        thousands always flocked to Jerusalem for the Pasch, and though the

        Synoptic Evangelists we learn that Jesus sent His disciples telling
        them where they should find the colt, and St. Matthew tells us that
        they brought the colt and its mother, and spread their garments upon
        both (ἐπ᾽ αὐτῶν, Matt. xxi. 7). They spread their garments upon both,
        because they did not know upon which He would choose to sit. And St.
        Matthew adds that Jesus sat <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">upon them</span></em> (ἑπάνω αὐτῶν); that is, as
        we take it, upon the garments that had been spread upon the colt. In
        this way the accounts of the four Evangelists are reconciled.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another difficulty
        occurs here, if we compare the parallel passage of St. Luke (xix.
        29). For, whereas St. John's account naturally leads us to suppose
        that the ass's colt was procured on the way <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">between</span></em>
        Bethania, where Christ had supped on the preceding night (xii.
        <a href="#XII_1" class="tei tei-ref">1</a>, <a href="#XII_2" class=
        "tei tei-ref">2</a>) and Jerusalem, St. Luke, on the other hand,
        says: <span class="tei tei-q">“And it came to pass <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">when He was come nigh
        to Bethphage and Bethania</span></em>, unto the mount called Olivet,
        He sent two of His disciples, saying, Go into the town which is over
        against you, at your <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg
        214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        entering into which you shall find the colt of an ass tied,”</span>
        &amp;c. We have searched in vain for a satisfactory solution of this
        difficulty. If the words of St. Luke are to be taken strictly as
        meaning that Christ was not merely near to, but <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">approaching</span></em> Bethania, then we would
        hold that on this morning, before the procession started, He had
        retired from Bethania eastward, and therefore farther away from
        Jerusalem, and was now again approaching the village on His way to
        the Holy City. There is nothing improbable in this supposition, for
        Christ did many things which the Evangelists have not recorded (John
        <a href="#XXI_24" class="tei tei-ref">xxi. 25</a>), and it enables us
        to reconcile two accounts, which are not easily reconciled
        otherwise.</p>

        His approaching Passion now disturbed His human soul, for as He was
        true man, His humanity naturally shuddered at the suffering and death
        He was about to undergo. Compare Matt. xxvi. 38; Mark xiv. 34.
        Christ, of course, permitted this fear to seize upon Him, so that it
        was wholly voluntary; and He manifested it at this particular time,
        probably lest His disciples should be tempted to say that it was easy
        for Him who was God to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg
        218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        exhort others to despise their life and endure suffering. He shows
        them, therefore, that He dreads death like the rest of men; and St.
        John records the fact because of the Docetae, who denied the reality
        of the Incarnation, and consequently of Christ's sufferings. See
        above on <a href="#I_14" class="tei tei-ref">i. 14</a>, and <a href=

        it, as if the meaning were: Shall I say to the Father to save Me from
        this hour? But we may understand the words as a conditional prayer
        proceeding from Christ's human will; conditional, that is, upon his
        Father's will to save Him from the Passion which He was to undergo,
        just as in St. Luke xxii. 42: <span class="tei tei-q">“Father, if
        Thou wilt, remove this chalice from Me; but not My will, but Thine be
        done.”</span> That such, indeed, is the meaning here, is proved by
        what follows, where Jesus retracts this conditional prayer, saying
        that it was for the very purpose that He might suffer, that He came
        unto this hour.</p>

        then, He prays absolutely to the Father to glorify His name by the
        sufferings and death of the Son. And a voice came from the air,
        produced there by God or an angel, saying: <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">I have both glorified
        (it), and will glorify (it) again</span></span>. The sense of these
        words of the Father is disputed. The Latin fathers understand the
        sense to be; I have glorified Thee from all eternity, and will
        glorify Thee again as God-man after Thy ascension. In favour of this
        view is the prayer of Christ: <span class="tei tei-q">“And now
        glorify Thou Me, O Father, with Thyself, with the glory which I had
        before the world was, with Thee”</span> (John <a href="#XVII_5"
        class="tei tei-ref">xvii. 5</a>). The Greek fathers, on the other
        hand, all take the sense to be: I have already glorified Thee by many
        miracles, and will again glorify Thee in the miracles to be wrought
        at Thy death, resurrection, and ascension, and afterwards by Thy
        followers in Thy name. It will be noted that the fathers generally
        understand the words of God the Father in reference to the
        glorification of Christ, whereas Christ's prayer regarded the
        glorification of the Father's name. We feel convinced, however, that
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">direct</span></em> object <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of glorification in both instances is the
        Father's name. For when Christ prays: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Glorify Thy name,”</span> and the Father answers:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I have glorified, and will again
        glorify,”</span> obviously the answer must refer to the glorification
        of the Father's name, for which Christ had prayed. Since, however,
        the glorification of the Father was to be brought about by the
        glorification of the Son; hence, this too is indirectly referred to,
        and our interpretation agrees substantially with that of the
        fathers.</p>

        since Satan was to be cast out, or deprived of his dominion over the
        world, therefore the world was to be liberated; (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) that
        verse 32 declares the effect of this judgment: the world shall be
        liberated, and as a consequence I shall draw all things to Myself;
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">c</span></span>) that the world to be judged is
        that over which Satan had ruled, and from which he was now to be cast
        out. But before the Incarnation he had held sway over the whole world
        (Rom. iii. 23, xi. 32; Gal. iii. 22). Therefore, it is the whole
        world that is to be judged, and hence there must be question of the
        judgment of liberation. So St. Aug., Mald., A Lap., Tolet., Beel.,
        Patriz.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In favour of the
        latter view, which is held by St. Chrysostom and most of the Greek
        fathers, it is argued—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        κρίσις of the judgment of condemnation; (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) that
        the world in the beginning of the verse is the same whose prince is
        to be deprived of his dominion; that, therefore, it should stand or
        fall with its prince; hence since he is to be stripped of his
        dominion, it is to be condemned; (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) that
        in the discourse after the Last Supper, Christ always means by the
        world, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">wicked</span></em> world, opposed to Himself
        (John xiv. <a href="#XIV_17" class="tei tei-ref">17</a>, <a href=

        the devil. See also 2 Cor. iv. 4; Eph. ii. 2, vi. 12. In the Talmud
        the same title is given to the prince of devils. By Christ's death
        the devil was cast out: that is, deprived of that almost universal
        sway which he had exercised over men before the coming of Christ.

        Christ does not mean to say that they could not believe after His
        death; but just as, though it is quite possible to walk during the
        time of darkness, still it is easier to walk in daylight, so it was

        closing this first part of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">narrative</span></em> portion of the Gospel (see
        <a href="#Intro_IV" class="tei tei-ref">Introd. iv.</a>), St. John
        pauses in the history to note the hard-hearted incredulity of the
        Jews, notwithstanding the fact that Christ had wrought <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">so many</span></em>
        miracles; an incredulity, however, which had been foretold by Isaias,
        which, therefore, came to pass now <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in order
        that</span></em> (ἱνα) the prediction of the Prophet should be
        fulfilled (verses 37, 38); and which came to pass necessarily
        (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">necessitate consequente</span></span>), because,
        as Isaias declared, they no longer had the abundant graces necessary
        in order that they might believe (verses 39, 40). Thus the
        incredulity of the Jews in our Lord's time was <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span></em>
        to the end that prophecy might be fulfilled. How then, we may ask,
        was that incredulity culpable, if those who were incredulous were not
        free and able to believe? The answer is, that this incredulity was
        necessary by a necessity consequent upon the prediction of the
        inspired Prophet, which prediction was itself consequent upon God's
        foreknowledge that the Jews would, culpably and of their own free
        will, remain incredulous. God foresaw this incredulity, predicted it,
        because He foresaw it was to be; and, of course, it came to pass, as
        He had foreseen it would. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg
        223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Hence, when God foresees, or His Prophet predicts, the commission of
        a certain sin, that sin is infallibly, yet freely committed. It is,
        as if we saw a man walking across a plain; he does so, not because we
        see him, but we see him because he walks. Similarly, in the boundless
        plain of His eternal present, God sees all things that are to be, and
        they happen, not because He sees them, but He sees them because they
        are to happen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Note, in verse 38,

        passes on to the history of the events of the night before our Lord's

        of the pasch.</span></span> We are here met by a serious difficulty
        when we compare with these words of St. John the accounts of the
        Synoptic Evangelists; for, while they represent the supper, referred
        to by St. John in verse 2, as having taken place on the evening of
        the first day of Azymes, St. John here seems to place it prior to
        that Feast. If we had only the Synoptic Gospels, we should, without
        any hesitation, come to the conclusion—(<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) that
        our Lord and His Apostles ate the Paschal Supper on the night
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227"
        id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> before He died; and
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">b</span></span>) that the Jews that year eat it
        on the same night. For St. Matthew tells us: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And on the first day of the Azymes, the disciples came
        to Jesus, saying: Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the
        pasch? But Jesus said: Go ye into the city to a certain man, and say
        to him: The Master saith, my time is near at hand; with thee I make
        the pasch with my disciples. And the disciples did as Jesus appointed
        to them, and they prepared the pasch. But when it was evening he sat
        down with his twelve disciples”</span> (Matt. xxvi. 17-20).
        Similarly, St. Mark (xiv. 12-17) and St. Luke (xxii. 7-14) seem to
        take for granted that the ordinary time for celebrating the Paschal
        Supper was come, for St. Mark says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Now on
        the first day of the unleavened bread, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">when they sacrificed
        the pasch</span></em>, the disciples say to him,”</span> &amp;c.; and
        St. Luke: <span class="tei tei-q">“And the day of the unleavened
        bread came, on which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">it was necessary</span></em> that the pasch
        should be killed.”</span> St. John, on the other hand, in the verse
        before us, in which he introduces his account of the events of this
        last night of Christ's mortal life, speaks of the time as;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Before</span></em> the festival day of the
        pasch.”</span> Moreover, in subsequent passages<a id="noteref_82"
        name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a> of our
        Gospel, to which we shall direct attention as they occur, St. John
        uses language which, at first sight, at least, would seem to show
        that the Jews did not eat the Pasch on the night of Christ's last
        supper, but on the following night, after He was crucified. Hence the
        difficulty of reconciling St. John's account with that of the
        Synoptic Evangelists. A vast amount of learning has been expended
        upon this question, and a great deal has been written upon it. We
        shall indicate as briefly as possible the different opinions, and
        state what seems to us most probable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) Some, as St.
        Clement of Alexandria, Calmet, &amp;c., have held that our Lord did
        not eat the Pasch at all in the last year of His life. They argue
        from texts in St. John, which prove, they say, that the time for
        eating the Pasch had not come until after Christ was put to death.
        They take the <span class="tei tei-q">“first day of the
        Azymes,”</span> in the Synoptic Gospels, to mean the 13th day of
        Nisan; and hold that it, and not the 14th, was so called because the
        Jews removed all leaven from their houses a day before the Feast.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228"
        id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> In this view they have no
        difficulty in reconciling St. John's account with that of the other
        Evangelists; for the Synoptic Evangelists are then made to represent
        the Last Supper as having taken place on the 13th of Nisan. That
        being so, it is at once concluded that there cannot be question of
        the Paschal Supper, but of an ordinary supper, and St. John, in
        agreement with the Synoptists, states that the supper in question was
        held <span class="tei tei-q">“before the festival day of the
        pasch.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This opinion,
        however, we regard as wholly improbable and untenable in the face of
        the statements of the Synoptic Evangelists, for these statements are
        such as to leave no reasonable doubt that our Lord and His Apostles
        did eat the Paschal Supper the night before He died. Thus, they tell
        us that the disciples were sent by our Lord to prepare the Pasch,
        that they prepared it, and that when the time for eating it was come,
        Christ sat down with the Twelve.<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83"
        href="#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a>
        Moreover, St. Luke tells us that after they sat down, Christ said:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“With desire I have desired to eat this pasch
        with you before I suffer”</span> (Luke xxii. 15)—words which clearly
        imply that on the occasion of that last supper the Pasch was eaten by
        Christ and the Apostles. Hence the opinion we are now considering,
        which would reconcile the Evangelists by holding that our Lord, on
        the night before He died, did not partake of the Paschal Supper, but
        only of an ordinary supper, is, as we have already said, wholly
        improbable; and, indeed, the book of a certain Florentine named
        Vecchietti, published at the close of the sixteenth century, and
        maintaining this view, was condemned by the Holy Office and its
        author imprisoned.<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href=
        "#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) Others,
        especially among the Greeks, admit that our Lord did eat the Paschal
        Supper on this occasion, but hold that He did so on the night
        following the 13th of Nisan, thus anticipating by a day the ordinary
        time for celebrating it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this view,
        too, seems to us very improbable; for the language of the Synoptic
        Evangelists appears to us to prove conclusively that our Lord did not
        anticipate the legal time for eating the Pasch, which, as we know
        from Exod. xii. 6, 8, and from tradition, was the night following the
        14th of Nisan. Thus St. Mark, in the passage already quoted, says:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, on the first day of the unleavened
        bread, when they sacrificed (ἔθυον, the Imperf. denoting what was
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">customary</span></em>) the pasch, the disciples
        say to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name=
        "Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Him: Whither wilt thou
        that we go, and prepare for thee to eat the pasch?”</span> (Mark xiv.
        12). And St. Luke: <span class="tei tei-q">“And the day of the
        unleavened bread came, on which it was <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span></em>
        (ἔδει) that the pasch should be killed”</span> (Luke xxii. 7). These
        texts, we believe, prove that our Lord celebrated His last supper on
        the night following the 14th of Nisan, the night on which the Jews
        were bound by their Law to eat the Pasch. Hence we unhesitatingly
        reject any view which supposes Him to have anticipated the legal time
        for the Paschal Supper.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) Others, as
        Harduin, Bisping, &amp;c., hold that the 13th of Nisan with the
        Judeans was the 14th with the Galileans, who therefore kept the Pasch
        a day earlier than the Judeans; and that our Lord, being a Galilean,
        did the same. This opinion, too, would enable us to readily reconcile
        the Evangelists; but unfortunately the assumption as to a difference
        of computation between the Judeans and Galileans is a mere
        conjecture, and has no evidence to support it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) Others, as
        Petav., Mald., Kuin., Coleridge,<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85"
        href="#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a> Cornely,
        &amp;c., hold that our Lord and the Apostles eat the Paschal Supper
        on the night of the 14th of Nisan, while the Jews that year eat it on
        the night of the 15th. Maldonatus holds that it was customary with
        the Jews from the time of the Babylonian captivity, whenever the
        first day of the Pasch fell on a Friday, to transfer it to Saturday,
        in order that two solemn feasts might not occur on successive days.
        According to this view, our Lord corresponded with the requirements
        of the Jewish Law; the Jews, on the other hand, followed the custom
        which had been introduced after the Babylonian captivity. In this
        view, too, it is easy to reconcile St. John's statement with those of
        the other Evangelists. He speaks of the night of the Last Supper, in
        reference to the feast as celebrated that year by the Judeans, and so
        places it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">before</span></em> the feast; they, on the other
        hand, speak of it in reference to the strict Law, and place it on the
        first day of Azymes, or rather on the night following the first day
        of Azymes.<a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href=
        "#note_86"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great names of
        many who have held this opinion, lend to it considerable probability,
        and if the custom which is alleged in its favour were <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> proved to have existed in the time of
        Christ, we would at once adopt it. But it is seriously disputed
        whether such a custom did exist at that time. It is true, indeed,
        that among the modern Jews, when the Paschal feast should begin on
        Friday, they always defer it till the Sabbath; and the Talmud is
        referred to by Comely (vol. iii., § 73, 1) as saying that the same
        has been the Jewish practice ever since the Babylonian captivity.
        Others, however, contend that the custom is not as old as the time of
        Christ, and that in His time the first day of the Pasch was kept on a
        Friday whenever it happened to fall on that day. Aben-Ezra (on Levit.
        xxiii. 4) says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Tam ex Mischna quam ex
        Talmude probatur Pascha in secundam, quartam, et <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sextam</span></em>
        feriam quandoque incidisse.”</span> Since, then, the hypothesis on
        which this opinion rests seems doubtful, the opinion itself appears
        to us less satisfactory than that which follows.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(5) Lastly, there
        is the old, and always the most common opinion, that our Lord did eat
        the Pasch at His last supper; that He eat it on the night of the 14th
        of Nisan; and that the Jews eat it on that same night. So St. Jer.,
        St. Aug., St. Anselm, Suarez, Tolet., A Lap., Benedict XIV., Patriz.,
        M'Carthy, Corluy, Didon. This opinion is certainly in accordance with
        the obvious meaning of the Synoptic Evangelists; and the objections
        against it, which are chiefly drawn from the Gospel of St.
        John,<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href=
        "#note_87"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a> can all
        be answered satisfactorily, as we shall show when discussing the
        passages on which they are founded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We hold, then,
        that Christ and the Jews eat the Pasch on the night following the
        14th of Nisan, when, according to the Jewish method of counting their
        days, the 15th had already commenced; and that Christ was put to
        death on the 15th, the first and most solemn day of the Paschal
        week.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now, returning
        to the text of St. John, we are confronted at the very commencement
        of this chapter by an objection to our view, in the words:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Before the festival day of the
        pasch.”</span> If Christ celebrated the Last Supper on the night
        after the 14th of Nisan, how does St. John speak of the time of this
        supper as <span class="tei tei-q">“before the festival day of the
        pasch”</span>? To this difficulty various answers have been given.
        (1) Some have replied that St. John means by <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“day”</span> the natural day, or time of light; and then
        it is plain that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg
        231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a
        supper celebrated on the night following the 14th was before the
        festival <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">day</span></em> of the 15th. This explanation is
        unsatisfactory, for in the original St. John does not merely say
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Before the festal day,”</span> but
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Before the festal period”</span> (πρὸ τῆς
        ἑορτῆς; comp., <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, vii. <a href="#VII_2" class=

        <a href="#VII_36" class="tei tei-ref">37</a>).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) Others say
        that the words πρὸ τῆς ἑορτῆς are equivalent to ἐν τῷ προεορτίῳ;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“quod ita praecedit festum, ut tamen sit pars
        festi”</span> are the words of Bochart, with whom Stier agrees. See
        Smith's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">B.
        D.</span></span>, Art. <span class="tei tei-q">“Passover.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) Others prefer
        to believe that as St. John wrote sixty years after the Last Supper,
        after he had spent many years in Asia Minor, and become accustomed to
        Greek habits of thought and expression, he speaks according to the
        Greek method of reckoning the day. The Greeks, like ourselves,
        reckoned their days from midnight to midnight; and St. John, speaking
        of the supper as taking place before the midnight that followed the
        14th of Nisan, might well refer it to a time previous to the
        festival.<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href=

        Incarnation. Knowing, then, that He was about to pass out of this

        ascension, go to share in the glory of the Father, having throughout

        night, as well in the washing of the Apostles' feet as in the
        institution of the Blessed Eucharist, the elevation of the Apostles
        to the dignity of the priesthood, and the loving discourse which
        followed this supper.</p>

        Commentators generally hold that the Paschal Supper on the present
        occasion was followed by the ordinary supper or evening meal, and
        this again by what we may call the Eucharistic Supper. It is
        generally held that the washing of the feet took place immediately
        after the Paschal Supper, or during the ordinary, and before the
        Eucharistic Supper. At the Paschal Supper the company at the table
        might not be less than ten nor more than twenty. In our Lord's time
        those partaking of the supper reclined on couches, this being the
        usage then, as standing had been originally. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The rites of the supper were regulated according to the
        succession of four, sometimes five, cups of red wine mixed with
        water, which were placed before the head of the house or the most
        eminent guest, who was called the celebrant, the president, or
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">proclaimer

        Jesus made Himself more like a servant, for servants were not

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The washing of the
        feet here referred to is not a sacrament; the practice of the Church
        makes this clear. Besides, it cannot be shown that grace was annexed
        to it. No doubt, without it Peter was to have no part with Christ;
        but this, we hold, would be the effect of disobedience, not the
        result of wanting anything which the washing could bestow. In
        reality, Peter was already in the state of grace, for in the tenth
        verse Jesus tells the Apostles that they are <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">clean</span></em>;
        and though He qualifies the statement by saying that all are not
        clean, yet St. John explains this qualification in reference to Judas
        only. Hence Peter was already in the state of grace, and there is
        nothing in the text or context to show that he was to obtain grace if
        his feet were washed, but only that he was to lose it if they were
        not.</p>

        authorities omit the words <span class="tei tei-q">“but”</span> and
        <span class="tei tei-q">“his feet,”</span> and the meaning whether in
        regard to body or soul is then clear and simple, namely, that he who
        has bathed has no need to wash, but is already clean. However, the
        words are much more probably genuine; and the difficulty they create
        is doubtless the reason why they are wanting in some authorities.
        Taking <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name=
        "Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> them as genuine, then,
        let us try to explain the verse. Some have understood our Lord to
        speak only of a corporal washing, as if He merely meant that the
        Apostles who had bathed, or at least washed their hands before this
        Supper (see above on <a href="#II_6" class="tei tei-ref">ii. 6</a>),
        now needed nothing except to have their feet washed. But the common
        opinion of commentators understands our Lord to speak of a spiritual
        washing, of which the washing of the feet was a symbol, and this view
        we accept. For the closing words of the verse: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And you are clean, but not all”</span> when taken
        together with St. John's explanation in verse 11, leave no doubt that
        our Lord speaks of spiritual cleanness, and therefore we may fairly
        conclude that He speaks also of a spiritual washing. He was about to
        wash their feet literally, but He intended that ceremony as a symbol
        of the higher cleansing process required of them and others as a
        fitting preparation before receiving the Blessed Eucharist. Such
        preparation was not absolutely necessary in their case, for they were
        already clean from mortal sin, but it was fitting and in some sense
        required, in order that they might remove the dust of venial sin,
        which was daily clinging to them in their contact with the world. It
        is clearly implied that if they had not been clean, that is to say,
        free from mortal sin, a more thorough cleansing would have
        necessary.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The meaning, then,

        bathed spiritually by having his soul cleansed from mortal sin, needs
        afterwards, as a fitting preparation for the Blessed Eucharist,
        merely that limited cleansing that was symbolized by the washing of
        only the feet.</p><a name="XIII_11" id="XIII_11" class=

        predestined, therefore Christ had not intended to speak of
        blessedness in connection with him. But since, in other parts of
        Scripture, Christ never attributes the act of predestinating to
        Himself, but only to the Father, hence we prefer, with Tol., Mald., A
        Lap., to understand here not of election to glory, but of the call to
        the Apostleship; and the sense is: I know what sort are the twelve
        whom I have chosen to be Apostles, and that one of them is not
        blessed, and never shall be. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        unworthy one of you is, still I called him to the Apostleship, that
        the Scripture might be fulfilled which foretold his ingratitude and
        guilt. That the prediction of the treachery of Judas did not deprive
        him of his liberty, nor extenuate his guilt, see above on <a href=
        "#XII_37" class="tei tei-ref">xii. 38</a>. The Scripture quoted is
        from Psalm xl. 10, where David complains of the ingratitude of some
        person whom he had treated as his familiar friend. David and his
        false friend were types of Christ and Judas; and, as we learn from
        the present passage of St. John, the mystical sense of David's words
        had reference to the betrayal of Christ by Judas. In the quotation,
        the words <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">shall lift</span></span> (or rather <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“has lifted,”</span> for <span lang="la" class=

        me</span></span>, are to be taken metaphorically. The meaning
        probably is that the ingratitude of Judas is like that of the beast
        which kicks him who feeds it and treats it kindly.</p><a name=

        "tei tei-ref">xi. 23</a>, this perturbation of soul was freely
        permitted by Christ. The disclosure of the traitor had been begun
        earlier in the night. It is recorded more or less fully by the four
        Evangelists, but in such a manner as to render it extremely probable
        that Christ returned to the subject several times during the night.
        St. Matthew (xxvi. 21, and foll.) and St. Mark (xiv. 18, and
        following) record the allusion to the traitor, immediately before the
        institution of the Blessed Eucharist. St. Luke, on the other hand,
        records it immediately after the same event: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This is the chalice, the New Testament, in my blood,
        which shall be shed for you. But yet behold, the hand of him that
        betrayeth me is with me on the table”</span> (Luke xxii. 20, 21). St.
        John does not refer, at least explicitly, to the institution of the
        Blessed Eucharist; but in his narrative the treachery of Judas is at
        first insinuated during the washing of the feet (verse 10); again
        alluded to in verse 18; and, finally, clearly foretold in verse 26.
        We can best reconcile all the Evangelists by holding that, in the
        hope of deterring Judas from his awful purpose, our Lord returned
        several times to the same subject: first, during the washing of the
        feet, as in St. John; then before the institution of the Blessed
        Eucharist, as in SS. Matthew and Mark; then, immediately after the
        institution, as in St. Luke; and finally, when the dipped bread was
        handed to the traitor, and he left the room, as in St. John.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        if the words in question (the words of the Synoptic Evangelists)
        contained, as seems generally to be taken for granted, a distinct
        identification of the traitor. For it could hardly be supposed that
        Judas, if thus pointed out, could have retained his place at the
        supper <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name=

        Apostles. But, in reality, there is no reason to regard the
        expressions recorded by St. Matthew and St. Mark—and the same may be
        said of that recorded by St. Luke—as thus distinctly identifying the
        one who was to betray our Lord.”</span></p>

        reading, St. John was not asked to inquire of Jesus who the traitor
        was, but St. Peter takes for granted that St. John had already
        learned from Jesus, and simply asks the beloved disciple to make it
        known to them all. In the other and less probable reading, St. John
        is asked <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to
        inquire</span></em> (πυθέσθαι) who the traitor is. It might seem more
        in accordance with St. Peter's character, that he should directly ask
        our Lord to point out the traitor, but it is possible that Christ's
        threat, recorded in verse 8, may have made him less confident than

        night</span></span>, no doubt in order to give completeness to the
        history, but possibly also to mark the contrast of the light Judas
        left behind him with the outer darkness into which he went forth.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Erat autem nox,”</span> says St. Aug.,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Et ipse qui exivit erat nox.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us here pause
        for a moment in the narrative of St. John to inquire whether the
        Blessed Eucharist was instituted before the departure of Judas;
        whether, therefore, he sacrilegiously received the Blessed Eucharist
        and was ordained priest at the Last Supper. The great majority of the
        fathers answer in the affirmative. This view seems to us extremely
        probable. For the Synoptic Evangelists all take care to tell us that
        Jesus sat down with the Twelve; and then a few verses afterwards,
        without any indication of a change in the company, without the
        slightest hint that anyone had departed, they proceed: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and
        blessed, and broke, and gave to His disciples, and said: Take ye, and
        eat; this is My body”</span> (Matt. xxvi. 26). Compare St. Mark and
        St. Luke. Hence, although they must have had the treachery of Judas
        before their minds while writing, yet they say not a word about his
        departure, as it might naturally be expected they would, if he had
        actually departed. Nay, St. Luke's version of our Lord's words
        clearly implies that Judas was present at the institution of the
        Blessed Eucharist; for in St. Luke our Lord seems to contrast His own
        love in instituting the Blessed <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Eucharist with the treachery of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one who was
        present</span></em>. <span class="tei tei-q">“This is the chalice,
        the New Testament in My blood, which shall be shed for you.
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">But
        yet</span></span> behold, the hand of him that betrayeth Me is with
        Me on the table”</span> (Luke xxii. 20, 21). Therefore, according to
        St. Luke, Judas was still at the table after the institution; and St.
        Mark states that all present drank of the chalice: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And they all drank of it”</span> (xiv. 23).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seems to us,
        then, much more probable that Judas received the Blessed Eucharist,
        and was ordained priest at the Last Supper. Many, however, hold the
        opposite view; among others, St. Hilary, Innocent III., Salmeron, B.
        Lamy, Corluy, Langen, and Cornely. The latter says that he agrees in
        this <span class="tei tei-q">“Cum plerisque modernis”</span> (Corn.,
        iii., p. 298, note). Their principal arguments are: (1) That St.
        Matthew, who was present at the Last Supper, records the disclosure
        of the traitor <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">before</span></em> the institution of the
        Eucharist, while we know from St. John (verse 30) that Judas departed
        when he was disclosed: therefore he departed before the institution
        of the Eucharist. But this argument loses its force, if we hold as
        above, that Christ referred on several occasions during the night to
        the treachery of Judas, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">only on the last occasion</span></em> definitely
        disclosed who the traitor was.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) They say, that
        surely our Lord did not allow Judas to make a sacrilegious Communion
        and receive Holy Orders, when He could so easily have prevented it.
        But we may reply that Christ referred several times to the betrayal,
        in order to recall Judas to a better sense; failing in this, He left
        him free, just as He leaves unworthy communicants or bad priests free
        now.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We believe, then,
        that modern commentators have no solid reason for departing from what
        was undeniably the common view in the early Church, that Judas at the
        Last Supper did receive Holy Communion and was ordained priest.</p>

        verse our Lord's last discourses begin. They are divided into two
        portions by the change of place at the close of chapter xiv., the
        first portion containing what was spoken in the Supper Room (xiii.
        31-xiv. 31); the second, what was spoken just outside the Supper Room
        or along the way to Gethsemane or at some point on the way (xv.,
        xvi.). In the first portion the leading ideas are that He

        id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and the Apostles are to be

        glorification of Christ implied His departure from the Apostles, and
        the time was now come for making known to them the separation. At
        present they, any more than His enemies, could not follow Him, and
        what He had before declared to His enemies (vii. <a href="#VII_33"
        class="tei tei-ref">33</a>, <a href="#VII_34" class=
        "tei tei-ref">34</a>), He now declares to His dearest friends. Yet,
        though the substance of the declaration is in both cases the same,
        Christ's purpose in making it was very different. To the Jews it was
        made in the hope that they would thus be urged to make good use of
        the time that still remained to them before the separation, while in
        the present case the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg
        247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        and putting before them various motives of consolation.</p>

        occurs only here in the Gospels, but is found six (or seven) times in
        St. John's First Epistle. The diminutive form is expressive of tender

        immature.</p>

        separation, but since that separation was to be followed in the case
        of the Apostles by spiritual union (xiv. 18, 23), hence He now omits
        the words: <span class="tei tei-q">“and shall not find me;”</span>
        though in the sense of not finding Him any longer visibly present

        far was Peter from being ready at that time to die for Him, that
        before cockcrow he would deny Him thrice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We believe that
        our Lord <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">twice</span></em> on this night predicted the
        denials by Peter: once in the supper-room, as recorded by St. John
        here, and by St. Luke (xxii. 34), and again on the way to Gethsemane,
        as recorded by St. Matt. (xxvi. 30-34), and St. Mark (xiv. 26-30). By
        the latter Evangelists the prophecy of Peter's denial is distinctly
        placed on the way to Gethsemane, and connected with the prophecy of
        the general desertion of the Apostles. This latter prophecy, it may
        well be, called forth from Peter a second expression of his fearless
        attachment to his Master, and this was followed in turn by a second
        reference to Peter's denials.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the other
        three Evangelists represent our Lord as saying that the three denials
        by Peter should take place before the cock would crow, St. Mark, who
        was a disciple of St. Peter, records the prediction more minutely,
        and represents our Lord as saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“Before
        the cock crow <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">twice</span></em>, thou shalt deny me
        thrice”</span> (Mark xiv. 30). There is, however, no contradiction
        between St. Mark and the others, even if all refer to the same
        prediction; for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">second</span></em> crowing of the cock, before
        which, according to St. Mark, the three denials were to take place,
        is that which is meant by the other Evangelists, and which was
        universally known as <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the</span></em>
        cockcrowing.”</span> That the cockcrowing in our Lord's time was
        regarded as so distinct a note of time as to have given its name to
        one of the four watches of the night, we have clear evidence in the
        Gospels. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg
        249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Thus, in St. Mark (xiii. 35), our Lord says: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Watch ye therefore (for you know not when the lord of
        the house cometh; at even, or at midnight, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">or at the
        cockcrowing</span></em>, or in the morning).”</span> Thus, then,
        although the cock crew after Peter's <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em>
        denial, as St. Mark records (Mark xiv. 68), still the time generally
        known as cockcrow—about 3 a.m.—was that meant when the word was used,
        as it is in our Lord's prediction in SS. Matt., Luke, and John,
        without any special indication that the first crowing of the cock was
        the one intended. Hence, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">second</span></em> crowing of the cock referred
        to by St. Mark was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        this chapter, it may be well, for clearness sake, to repeat here what

        Supper.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) There was the
        Paschal Supper.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) During the
        Paschal Supper, or at its close (but certainly before the ordinary
        supper was over: see above on verse 2), the washing of the feet,
        accompanied by the first allusion to the traitor (John xiii. 10).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) The ordinary
        supper, during which</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) Another
        reference to the traitor (Matt. xxvi. 21 <span class=

        Mark xiv. 18 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(5) The
        Eucharistic Supper.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(6) A third
        reference to the traitor (Luke xxii. 21).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(7) The strife
        among the Apostles as to which of them was the greatest, occasioned,
        perhaps, by the anxiety of each to shift from himself the charge of
        treachery.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(8) The question
        of St. John (John xiii. 25), and the final disclosure of the traitor,
        who quits the supper room.</p>

        Supper, begun in xiii. 31, Jesus begins to console the Apostles. He
        saw that they were sore at heart, as well they might be, on account
        of what He had foretold that night—the treachery of one of their

        wherein He exercised the rights of a Son. <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) Some explain
        thus. If not, yet even in that case I would have told you that I go
        to prepare a place for you (my intimate friends). And if (in that
        case) I should go to prepare a place you, I would return, &amp;c.
        Against this view, however, it is fairly objected that Christ's going
        is thus represented as purely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">hypothetical</span></em>, whereas from the text
        it seems to be real: <span class="tei tei-q">“And if I shall go ... I
        will come again.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) Others thus:
        If not, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you?
        In this view a note of interrogation is supplied, a thing that the
        original text, which was unpointed, admits; and reference is made to
        some past occasion when He promised to go and prepare places for
        them. That we have no record of a promise made in so many words, does
        not prove, of course, that it was not made.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) Others thus:
        If not, I would have told you <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">so. But, in fact, there are many
        mansions</span></em>, for I go to prepare a place for you. Against
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252"
        id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> this view it is objected that
        it supplies an ellipsis, which is in no way indicated in the text.
        The same meaning, however, may be had without any ellipsis, if the
        words: <span class="tei tei-q">“If not, I would have told you”</span>
        be regarded as parenthetic. The sense will then be: in My Father's
        house there are many mansions (if not, I would have told you), as is
        proved by the fact that I go to prepare a place for you.</p>

        of both. We prefer the last opinion, for while Christ took the souls
        of the Apostles to the mansions of bliss at their particular
        judgment, it is only at the general judgment that He will take their
        bodies and perfect their felicity. The words cannot refer to the
        continual coming of Christ to the Church through the Holy Ghost whom
        He has sent; such a meaning is excluded by the words that follow:

        <span class="tei tei-q">“No man cometh to the Father but by

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">7. Having told
        them that He Himself is the way, He now proceeds to point out to them
        that if they had known this way in the manner they ought, they should
        also have known the term towards which it led. Hence the sense is:
        You would know the Father to whom I go, if you knew Me; for I and the
        Father are the same divine substance (John <a href="#X_29" class=
        "tei tei-ref">x. 30</a>). Thomas had said that they did not know the
        term of Christ's journey, and therefore could not know the way
        thereto, implying that the way was to be known from, or at least
        after, the term to which it led. Christ now declares that the reverse
        is the case; and if they had known Him, the way, they should also
        have known the Father. The words: <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">If you had known
        me</span></span>, imply that they had not yet known Christ as they
        ought. They had indeed known Him to some extent as He admits in verse
        4, but they had not realized fully His Divinity and consubstantiality
        with the Father, else they would have implicitly known the Father in
        knowing Him. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">And from henceforth you shall know him, and you
        have seen him.</span></span> We would render the Greek thus:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">even now</span></em> (see John <a href=
        "#XIII_19" class="tei tei-ref">xiii. 19</a>) you know Him, and you
        have seen Him.”</span> The sense is, that even now they knew the

        Christ, because, as Christ adds in verse 9: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He who seeth me, seeth the Father also.”</span> Thus it
        was true that in an imperfect manner they knew whither Christ went,
        and the way thereto (verse 4), yet equally true that they knew
        neither way nor term so clearly as they might, considering that He
        had now for more than three years been gradually revealing Himself to
        them.</p>

        non est Socrates, quia Socrates est quid compositum, sed in divinis
        essentia est idem personae secundum rem, et sic essentia Patris est
        Pater, et essentia Filii, Filius. Ubicumque ergo est essentia Patris,
        est ipse Pater, et ubicumque est essentia Filii, est ipse Filius.
        Essentia autem Patris est in Filio et essentia Filii est in Patre.

        comforter, advocate, or helper. Bearing in mind the tribulations in
        which the Apostles were already, and the still greater ones that
        awaited them, we think the principal meaning here is that of
        comforter. But this does not exclude the other meanings, especially
        that of helper, which the Holy Ghost undoubtedly was in an eminent
        degree. This other Comforter, who is promised in Christ's stead, will
        not leave the Apostles, as Christ did, but is to remain with them for
        ever. It is disputed whether the Holy Ghost is here promised only to
        the Apostles, or, in them, to the whole teaching Church. In the first
        case, <span class="tei tei-q">“for ever,”</span> would mean during
        their lives; in the second, it would mean till the end of the world,
        as long as the Church shall endure. This latter sense we prefer,
        for—(1) the words <span class="tei tei-q">“for ever”</span> favour
        this view; (2) though the Apostles needed a comforter, yet not they
        only, but their successors quite as much; (3) this spirit is promised
        to teach them all truth (John <a href="#XVI_13" class=
        "tei tei-ref">xvi. 13</a>); why, except in order that they through
        themselves <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">and their successors</span></em> might teach the
        world? (4) we know from the event that on the day of Pentecost the
        Holy Ghost came not to the Apostles alone (Acts ii. 4). We hold then
        that the Holy Ghost is here promised to the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ecclesia
        docens</span></span>, represented by the Apostles, to abide with her
        for ever.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In either
        interpretation it cannot be proved from this text that the Apostles
        were to be confirmed in grace after the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> descent of the Holy Ghost, for it is enough for
        the fulfilment of the promise here made that the Holy Ghost was to
        be, as far as in Him lay, an enduring Comforter, though the Apostles,
        on their part, might expel and banish Him. This verse proves the
        personality of the Holy Ghost, for He is sent in the place of Christ
        (see also verse 26). It proves also His Divinity, for only a Divine
        Person would be thus compared to Christ, and spoken of as <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another</span></em>
        Comforter. Moreover the procession of the Holy Ghost from the Father
        is here implied in the fact that the Father is said to send the Holy
        Ghost. For the sending of one Divine Person by another, implies the
        Eternal Procession of one from the other with a relation to some term
        in time.<a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the following
        words the Apostles are told that the wicked world (i. 10; xiv. 30;
        xvii. 9, 16) cannot receive the Holy Ghost, for as St. Paul says:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the sensual man perceiveth not these things
        that are of the Spirit of God; for it is foolishness to him, and he
        cannot understand: because it is spiritually examined”</span> (1 Cor.

        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">It seeth him not, nor

        with the eyes of the body, nor discerneth Him by spiritual vision;
        others, and with more probability, take both clauses as synonymous
        and in reference to spiritual vision. The sense is that because the
        wicked world will refuse to recognise the Holy Ghost, it will be
        incapable of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg
        259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        receiving Him at His coming. Want of vision shall be a hindrance to

        because he shall abide with you, and shall be in you.</span></span>
        Reversing the order of thought, He now says that the presence of the
        Holy Ghost abiding in the Apostles shall bring them still fuller
        knowledge. Such seems to be the sense of the verse according to the
        Vulgate reading. But in the latter part of the verse, instead of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“shall know”</span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“shall abide,”</span> we have in both instances the
        present tense in the Greek, and many authorities also read the
        present instead of <span class="tei tei-q">“shall be.”</span> The
        clause would then run: <span class="tei tei-q">“but you know him
        because he abides with you and is in you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But even in this
        reading the present may stand for the future, and the meaning will be
        the same as in the Vulgate.</p>

        had spoken of His coming to them, and had put it forward as a motive
        of consolation (verse 3), but the coming there meant we take to be
        different from that now referred to, and hence a new motive of
        consolation is now put forward in the coming promised here.</p>

        Christ is here promised.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) Some hold that
        the reference is to the coming after His resurrection when we know He
        appeared to the Apostles but was unseen by the world. So St. Chrys.,
        St. Thom., Patriz., &amp;c.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) Others hold
        that there is question of the coming at the Day of Judgment. As the
        years are measured before God, only <span class="tei tei-q">“a little
        while”</span> shall elapse till then, and it is only after the Day of
        Judgment that the promise of verse 20: <span class="tei tei-q">“In
        that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I
        in you”</span> shall be fully realized. So St. Aug., Mald.,
        &amp;c.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) Others
        understand of the coming of Christ in and with the Holy Ghost on the
        day of Pentecost. If the consubstantiality and circumincession of the
        three Divine Persons be borne in mind, the whole passage that follows
        as far as verse 24, will then be naturally explained. So St. Cyril,
        Beel., Bisp., &amp;c. We prefer the last view, and hold that from
        15-24, there is question of the coming of the Holy Ghost, first in
        reference to the Apostles (15-20), and then in reference to the
        faithful generally (21-24). In reference to the Apostles, the coming
        of the Holy Ghost is first considered in itself (15-17), and next,
        for their consolation, as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg
        260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        implying and including the coming of Christ Himself (18-20).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though this view
        may at first sight seem forced, we believe that if the connection in
        the passage be followed closely, it must appear the most probable.
        For when St. Jude, alluding to the words of verse 19, asks, in verse
        22, how Christ shall be seen by the Apostles, yet unseen by the
        world, Christ's reply, in verse 23, goes to show that the vision is
        spiritual, and such as is explained by the fact, that He and His
        Father will come and make their abode in those that love Him.</p>

        indeed, with the eyes of the body, but with those of the soul;
        because I live (the present being used, perhaps, of His Divine life,

        and that for this reason they shall be privileged to see Him
        spiritually. That there is question of spiritual vision, is proved,
        we believe, from what follows; for they shall see according as He
        shall manifest Himself (verse 21); and this manifestation of Himself
        He explains in verse 23 of His abiding in them.</p>

        that the words are in no way Christ's, is a Hebraism, and means that
        they are not His alone. See above on <a href="#VII_16" class=

        was equal in every way to that of the Father's, but since the
        Apostles did not yet fully realize His Divinity with all that it
        implied, He invokes the Father's authority as having more weight with
        them.</p><a name="XIV_25" id="XIV_25" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        taught by the Holy Ghost, the spirit of truth (verse 17). And since
        they were endowed with this infallible teaching authority in order
        that they might teach the flock of Christ (xv. 16); since, moreover,
        there is still the same need for an infallible teaching authority in
        the Church, if the work of Christ and His Apostles is to be continued

        This is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        triumphantly pointed to the words: <span class="tei tei-q">“The

        is inferior to the Father. For He had already told them that He is in

        accompanied by the Apostles, now left the supper-room. Had they not
        done so, St. John would probably have referred to the delay. Whether
        they paused in a porch or court of the house, or at some quiet spot
        on the way, till the discourse and prayer to the Father (xv.-xvii.)
        were spoken, or proceeded immediately through the city towards the
        Garden of Olives, and had arrived at the brook of Cedron (John
        <a href="#XVIII_1" class="tei tei-ref">xviii. 1</a>), when Christ
        concluded, is disputed. Bearing in mind the crowded condition of
        Jerusalem during the Paschal week, and that probably it was hardly
        yet 10 p.m., when the streets would be still thronged with people, we
        think it extremely unlikely that such a discourse and prayer, as are
        contained in John xv.-xvii. 26, were spoken while Christ and the
        Apostles passed through the streets of the city. We think it most
        probable, then, that they paused at some quiet spot on the outskirts
        of the city, or in a porch or court of the house where they had
        supped.</p>

        of abiding in Him by faith and love. For this purpose He compares
        Himself to the stem of the vine, and the Apostles to its branches. As
        the branches draw all their life and nourishment from the stem, so
        must the Apostles draw all their spiritual life from Him. This idea
        would be illustrated by the relation between the trunk of any tree
        and its branches. The chief reason, then, why He compares Himself to
        the vine is because it was customary to prune its branches, and He
        was about <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg
        267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to
        speak of the pruning of His mystical branches by the Father.<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a> He is
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        true</span></em>, that is the perfect vine, because He nourishes His
        members more perfectly than does any vine tree its branches. In a
        similar sense He is the true light (John <a href="#I_7" class=
        "tei tei-ref">i. 9</a>), and the true bread (John <a href="#VI_32"
        class="tei tei-ref">vi. 32</a>).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He is the <span class="tei tei-q">‘vine’</span> in His
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">humanity</span></em>, in which the branches of
        the same nature are united with Him. But it is from His <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Divinity</span></em>
        the branches derive the spiritual and life-giving influence that
        leads to eternal happiness”</span> (MacEv.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is needless to
        say, that in calling Himself the true vine, Christ does not mean to
        signify that He is really a vine. The language is plainly
        metaphorical, and is so explained by our Lord Himself in verses 4 and
        5. Hence it bears no comparison with the words used by Christ in
        instituting the Blessed Eucharist. In the latter case He declared
        that what He held in His hands was His body, and there was nothing in
        His words, or in the circumstances in which they were uttered to
        point to a figurative sense. On the contrary, His discourse delivered
        twelve months beforehand in the Synagogue of Capharnaum, and recorded
        in the sixth chapter of our Gospel, prepared the Apostles to receive
        His words, mysterious though they must have seemed, in the literal
        sense.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">And my Father is the
        husbandman.</span></span> The Father attends to and purifies Christ's
        followers in a manner similar to that employed by the vine-dresser,
        that so they may produce more abundant fruit. The Arians appealed to
        this text to show that Christ was inferior to God. For as the vine
        and the husbandman are not of the same nature, so neither, they said,
        are Christ and the Father of the same nature. We answer that in
        metaphorical language the comparison is not to be pressed too far,
        only indeed in that particular, or in regard to that point, for the
        illustration of which the metaphor is employed. See above on <a href=
        "#X_3" class="tei tei-ref">x. 3</a>. Now in the present instance
        Christ points out (in verse 4) that His metaphorical language is
        designed to show the necessity for the Apostles of union with
        Himself. Nothing therefore can be inferred in regard to His
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nature</span></em> and the Father's. In reality,
        Christ, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as
        God</span></em>, was husbandman, as well as the Father; but as it
        would not suit the comparison to call <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Himself both vine and husbandman, He attributes
        the office of husbandman to the Father. <span class=

        may be unfruitful and yet really remain branches, and members of
        Christ's Church. The sense of Christ's words is: Every Christian that
        beareth not the fruit of good works, the Father <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">takes</span></em>
        away (Gr. present), either in this life, by permitting them to fall
        into heresy, or at death when they shall no longer remain members of
        the Church. They are therefore lopped off like useless branches. The
        good, too, are purified by the Father, who <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prunes</span></em>
        their hearts, removing therefrom all impediments to perfection,
        taking away everything that would hinder or impede the vital power in
        the production of spiritual fruit. As even the best branches are
        improved by judicious pruning, so the just are rendered more perfect
        by the purifying action of the Divine Husbandman. Αὐτο in both cases
        is redundant.</p>

        they were not able of themselves to abide in Him or to bear any
        supernatural fruit except through His grace. The words refute the

        the Greek text makes this clear. As we said above on verse 1, the

        1, both of the persecutions which were before them, and of the coming

        Apostles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But had He not

        Mald., that He had never predicted persecution until now, and that
        St. Matthew, in recording, in the passage cited, the prediction of
        persecution, does not follow the order of time, but inserts, in
        connection with the mission of the Apostles to the Jews what was
        spoken long after, probably immediately before, Christ's ascension,
        when they were receiving their mission to the whole world. (Matt.
        xxviii. 19, 20). Or we may reply—and this answer we prefer—that
        although He had before predicted the persecution of the Apostles, yet
        He had not till now told them what He told them on this occasion;
        namely, that they should be excommunicated by the Jews, and that men
        would think they were actually honouring God in persecuting them. So
        that although He had before predicted persecution, still it was only
        now He predicted its terrible violence.</p>

        Our Lord probably remained silent for a few moments after announcing
        His departure, in order to see if anyone would question Him further
        about it. Since no one <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg
        280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        did, He mildly reminds them in the words before us, that they are not
        sufficiently solicitous to learn the things that concerned Him; but,
        as He goes on to say in verse 6, are too much occupied with their own
        sorrows. No doubt, Peter had already asked Him: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Lord, whither goest Thou?”</span> (John <a href=
        "#XIII_36" class="tei tei-ref">xiii. 36</a>); and Thomas had said:

        how can we know the way?”</span> (John <a href="#XIV_5" class=
        "tei tei-ref">xiv. 5</a>), but they had not persevered in asking; and
        at present, when He is just about to depart, they put Him no
        questions about the glory that was before Him, or the nature of the
        kingdom that awaited Him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">8-11. We may take
        these four verses together, as the three last explain the first.
        Christ goes on to show why it is expedient for the Apostles that He
        should leave them, and that the Holy Ghost should come. <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">And when he is come, he
        will convince</span></span>, &amp;c. The Greek word for <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“will convince”</span> is ἐλένξει, which may mean
        either—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">a</span></span>) to rebuke, or (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) to
        prove a thing clearly so that it must be admitted. It is not
        absolutely necessary that the word be used in the same sense
        throughout these verses; but since there is nothing to indicate that
        it is used in different senses, we take it in the same sense
        throughout. This sense we believe to be the second just indicated,
        for this alone suits verses 10 and 11.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The meaning of the
        whole passage, then, we take to be the following:—And when the Holy
        Ghost is come, He will clearly prove to the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">unbelieving</span></em> world, principally
        through your preaching and miracles, its own sin, My justice, and its
        own condemnation. Its own sin of incredulity, which is proved by the
        fact that the children of this wicked world did not believe in Me
        (verse 9); My justice, which is proved by the fact that I go to God
        to reign with Him for ever, so that men shall see Me no more; its own
        condemnation, which is shown to be certain by the fact that its
        prince, the devil, is already condemned. Christ's victory over the
        devil at His death implied the condemnation of the devil's kingdom,
        the world. And as Christ's death was so near, the devil might be said
        to be already condemned.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If it be objected
        to our interpretation that, since there is question in verses 9 and
        11 of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">world's</span></em> sin and condemnation, so
        there must be question of the world's justice in verse 10, we reply
        that Christ makes it sufficiently clear that He is speaking in verse
        10 of His own justice by the words He adds: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Because I go to the Father, and you shall see Me no
        longer.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If it be objected
        that the Holy Ghost did not prove to the world its own sin, nor
        Christ's justice, nor its own condemnation, we reply that He did,
        though the world in many of its children closed its eyes to the
        proof; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        (Ps. cxiii. 5.) The world saw in the sanctity of the Christian
        religion, in the miracles wrought by Christ's followers, in the power
        of the Apostles and their successors over devils and those possessed
        by devils, what ought to have convinced it of Christ's Divinity, and
        of its own sin and inevitable condemnation.</p><a name="XVI_12" id=

        able to bear were, probably, the nature of His earthly kingdom, and
        the abrogation of the Jewish Law, in as far as it was judicial and
        ceremonial. As Jews who had grown up imbued with deepest reverence
        for the Mosaic Law, the Apostles were naturally slow to believe that
        it was to be abrogated; and immediately before St. Peter received
        Cornelius into the Church as the first-fruits of the Gentile world,
        he had to be taught by a vision from heaven that the Jewish
        distinction between clean and unclean meats was no longer to exist.
        (Acts x. 10-16.) And as to the nature of Christ's earthly kingdom,
        the Apostles in common with the rest of their race still hoped that
        the Messias would establish a mighty Jewish empire, and restore
        Israel to a foremost place among the nations. Even on Ascension day
        they still cherished this hope, as we learn from the Acts:

        Greek for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        now unable to bear). We are not to suppose that the Apostles were
        taught all the truth on the day of Pentecost; the revelation was
        vouchsafed gradually, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg

        the Apostles' time, doctrines and dogmas have, indeed, been more
        fully drawn out and developed, but no new doctrines have been
        revealed. This follows clearly from the words we are considering; for
        it was to the Apostles, to those same men who were now unable to bear
        it, that the Holy Ghost was to teach the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole</span></em>
        truth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The promise here
        made to the Apostles, that they should be taught the whole truth by
        the Holy Ghost, while it regarded them <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">directly</span></em>,
        regarded the whole Church indirectly; for it is to them as Apostles,
        appointed to teach the whole Church, that Christ speaks: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have chosen you, and have appointed you, that you
        should go, and should bring forth fruit, and your fruit should
        remain”</span> (John <a href="#XV_16" class="tei tei-ref">xv.
        16</a>). And in the solemn prayer to the Father, with which this
        discourse concludes, He prays the Father: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sanctify them (the Apostles) in (the) truth.... And not
        for them only do I pray, but for them also who, through their word,
        shall believe in me.”</span> So that the Apostles first, and through
        them the Church of Christ, received the whole truth from the Holy
        Ghost.<a id="noteref_102" name="noteref_102" href=

        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">For he shall not speak of
        himself.</span></span> These words give a reason why the Holy Ghost
        shall teach the truth. No other reason than His own Divinity and
        essential truthfulness was necessary; but, as the Apostles did not
        yet understand that this new Comforter was Divine, Jesus vouchsafes
        another reason to convince them of His truthfulness. This other
        reason is, that the Holy Ghost shall speak to them, not what has been
        excogitated or invented by Himself, but what he received from the Son
        of God in His eternal procession. Doubtless the Apostles did not yet
        know much about the mystery of the Divine procession; still they
        could gather from these words that the new Comforter was to announce
        to them the truth, as Christ's legate, and this was enough.</p>

        anything except in His procession; for once He is a Divine Person He

        possess. Hence whatever the Holy Ghost <em class=

        afforded for the procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) First,
        they supplied πατρός after τοῦ ἐμοῦ, and thus represented Christ as
        saying that the Holy Ghost should receive from the Father. Hence they
        concluded that He proceeds only from the Father. But we say in
        reply—(1) that it is against the rules of Greek syntax that the
        possessive pronoun τοῦ ἐμοῦ should refer to a word not expressed in
        the phrase. (2) That all the fathers, Greek as well as Latin,
        referred τοῦ ἐμοῦ to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">what is in the Son</span></em> and not to the
        Father. (3) The context here Proves that τοῦ ἐμοῦ does not refer to
        the Father. For in verse 15 we have the pronoun repeated in the
        plural: <span class="tei tei-q">“All things whatsoever the Father
        hath <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are
        mine</span></em> (ἐμά ἐστιν). Therefore I said, he shall receive of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">mine</span></em>,”</span> and it is plain that
        in both instances <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">mine</span></em> refers to the same thing; hence
        not to the Father, but to what is in the Son, communicated from the
        Father.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>)
        Equally inadmissible is the other interpretation by which it was
        attempted to explain away this text. According to this second view,
        Christ's words would mean: The Holy Ghost shall glorify Me because He
        shall receive of Mine <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">from My Father</span></em>, and shall show it to
        you. But there is nothing to justify this insertion of the words
        <span class="tei tei-q">“from My Father;”</span> on the contrary, the
        whole context points to the fact that the Holy Ghost is to receive
        what is the Son's (of mine) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">from the Son Himself</span></em>. For since the
        Holy Ghost in reality glorified the Father and Himself as well as the
        Son, when we find it here stated that He shall glorify the Son,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">because</span></em> He shall receive of Him, the
        natural inference is, that He receives from Him directly, and not
        merely through the Father. Besides, when the text distinctly states
        that the Holy Ghost shall receive of the Son, it is wholly arbitrary
        and really not an interpretation of the words at all to say that He
        receives of the Son <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">through the Father</span></em>, and not directly
        of the Son Himself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hence the words of
        this verse plainly mean that the Holy Ghost receives from the Son,
        and consequently, as we saw above on verse 13, afford a proof that He
        proceeds from the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg
        286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Son, just as those of xv. 26 prove that He proceeds from the Father.
        He proceeds, therefore, as our faith professes, Ex Patre <span class=

        more probable reading, but it is used for the future, so that the
        Vulgate gives the meaning. This verse is variously connected with the
        preceding, even by Catholic commentators. We believe that Christ is
        here proving what He has just said, namely, that the Holy Ghost
        should receive of Him. The proof is this: All whatsoever the Father
        hath (except, of course, the relation of Paternity) is the Son's; but
        the Father has <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">spiratio activa</span></span>:
        in other words, the Holy Ghost proceeds from Him, therefore He
        proceeds from the Son also: <span class="tei tei-q">“All things
        whatsoever the Father hath are mine; <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">therefore</span></em>
        I said, He shall receive of mine, and shew it to you.”</span> Note
        that this verse, too, furnishes a clear proof of the procession of
        the Holy Ghost from the Son, since the Son has all that the Father
        hath.</p>

        of course, it is possible that St. John did not record them.</p>

        then another <span class="tei tei-q">“little while,”</span> namely

        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">after</span></em>
        that they should see Him risen to a glorious and immortal life.
        According to the other, the first <span class="tei tei-q">“little
        while”</span> is the time until the ascension, and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">after</span></em>
        that they should see Him no longer among them on earth; the second
        <span class="tei tei-q">“little while”</span> is the time from the
        ascension until the day of general judgment, and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">after</span></em>
        that they should see Him for ever, their joy no man should take from

        287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        22), and they would require to ask Him no questions (verse 23),
        because all would be clear in the light of the beatific vision.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We prefer the
        latter view; for when Christ goes on in the following verses to
        explain, His words, especially in verses 22 and 23, are not easily or
        naturally understood in the first interpretation. For, though the
        Apostles did rejoice after His resurrection (John xx. 20), and though
        that glorious event with all that it implied must have been to them a
        source of lasting joy, still they had very many occasions for
        sorrowing subsequently. Besides, we know that after His resurrection
        they put Him questions (Acts i. 6). Hence, we prefer to hold that the
        second <span class="tei tei-q">“little while”</span> (with the Lord a
        thousand years are as one day, 2 Peter iii. 8) shall terminate with
        the day of judgment, for then only shall they require to put Him no
        questions, and both body and soul shall be for ever happy.</p>

        Christ, after promising the Apostles the knowledge of future things

        anything</span></span>, &amp;c. These words ought to begin a new
        verse, for a new subject, the efficacy of prayer, is begun. The
        correct Greek reading is ἄν τι (not ὅτι ὅσα ἄν), and agrees with the
        Vulgate, <span class="tei tei-q">“si quid.”</span> Most critics of
        the Greek text read the latter part of this verse thus: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If you ask the Father anything, He will give it you in
        my name.”</span> Still we are inclined to believe that the Vulgate
        reading, which connects <span class="tei tei-q">“in my name”</span>
        with <span class="tei tei-q">“ask”</span> and not with <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“will give,”</span> is correct; for immediately after (in
        verses 24 and 26) we have question of asking in the name of Christ.
        Moreover, the connection between verses 23 and 24, with the apparent
        antithesis: <span class="tei tei-q">“if you ask the Father anything
        in my name, He will give it you. Hitherto you have not asked anything
        in my name,”</span> confirms the Vulgate reading. We prefer the
        Vulgate reading therefore, and the sense is, that if they ask the
        Father anything in the name, through the merits, of Christ, He will
        give it; provided, of course, as St. John says in his First Epistle
        (v. 14) they ask according to the will of God. Hence the Church
        always asks through the merits of Christ: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Per Christum Dominum nostrum,”</span> or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Per Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum,”</span> &amp;c.</p>

        along the streets, we would hold that this prediction, recorded by
        St. John, is a different one, and that Christ referred twice on this
        night to the desertion of His Apostles. In reality, however, SS.
        Matthew and Mark can be satisfactorily explained on the supposition
        that the prediction which they record was spoken outside the house

        consoling and encouraging assurance that He was just about to conquer
        the world (by prolepsis He speaks of His victory as already gained).
        The context shows that this assurance implied that they too, through

        men. There are various other interpretations, but the above seems to
        us best, as it connects naturally with the preceding, and retains the
        ordinary signification of καθώς and ἵνα.</p>

        whom Thou hast sent. The Greek ἵνα γινώσκωσίν σε τὸν μόνον ἀληθινὸν
        θεόν shows that the Father is here said to be the only God, to the
        exclusion of other Gods, but not to the exclusion of other Persons
        who participate in the same Godhead. It is not meant that the Father
        is the only Divine Person. There are other Persons in the Godhead,
        but there is no other Godhead. The words mean, then, that they may
        know Thee to be the only true God, to the exclusion of all other
        Gods; but do not mean that they may know Thee alone to be the true
        God, to the exclusion of the Son and Holy Ghost.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many of the
        fathers adopt another interpretation of the verse, holding that the
        order of the words is inverted, and that Divinity is predicated of
        both the Father and Christ. They understand the verse thus: that they
        may know Thee and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent, to be the only
        true God. So SS. Aug., Amb., Hil., Greg. Naz., Athan., Cyp.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296"
        id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The latter interpretation more
        clearly establishes Christ's Divinity against the Arians; but in any
        interpretation it is clear that Christ implies His own Divinity,
        since He declares that the knowledge of Himself, equally with that of
        the Father, is the cause and pledge of eternal life. He who had said:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I and the Father are one”</span> (John x.
        30), and who, a few verses farther down in this prayer, says to the
        Father: <span class="tei tei-q">“All my things are thine, and thine
        are mine,”</span> cannot reasonably be supposed to withdraw His
        claims to Divinity in the words before us.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some of the
        fathers, and many of the scholastics, hold that there is question in
        verse 3 not of the knowledge of God through <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">faith</span></em>,
        but of the knowledge of the blessed in heaven; and they argue from
        this verse to prove that the essence of life eternal consists in
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">knowing</span></em> God; in other words, that
        the happiness of the blessed consists in an act of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">intellect</span></em>; namely, the vision of
        God.<a id="noteref_108" name="noteref_108" href=

        we believe that the question here is of the knowledge of God through
        faith, and not through the beatific vision, we hold that no argument
        can be drawn from this verse as to the essence of the happiness of
        the blessed.</p>

        heaven. There is a difficulty here, arising from the fact that Christ
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297"
        id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> seems to pray that the glory

        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as

        the blessed humanity of Christ is incapable of partaking fully
        thereof. Hence various interpretations have been advanced in order to
        explain this difficulty:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) Some say that
        Christ, as man, prays merely for that glory which, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the decrees of
        God, was given</span></em> to His humanity from all eternity. But
        against this view is the fact that the fathers generally quoted the
        latter part of this verse to prove the eternal existence and Divinity
        of Christ.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) Hence others,
        and we believe rightly, hold that in the latter part of the verse
        there is question of the Divine and eternal glory of Christ, and
        understand Him to pray that His humanity, according to its capacity,
        may be made to partake of the glory of the Divinity. Of course, the
        humanity was incapable of receiving the infinite glory of the
        Divinity; but the glorious qualities of Christ's glorified body are a
        participation, according to the capacity of the body, of the eternal
        glory of the Son. <span class="tei tei-q">“Da ut claritas et gloria

        is speaking only of this particular prayer, in which He asks for the
        Apostles what the world was unfit and unwilling to receive (see
        verses 13, 17, 18).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fact, then,

        οὕς), ὧ being attracted into the dative case of the preceding noun,
        and standing for ὁ. The most probable meaning of this Greek reading
        is: keep them in the confession of Thy name, in the knowledge of
        Thee, which Thou hast given to Me, and which I in turn have given to
        them; that they may be one by a union of faith and charity

        signifies to make holy, or to make more holy, or to keep more holy (1
        Cor. vii. 11; 1 Thess. v. 23); at other times, it means to set apart
        or destine for an office; and in this sense it is generally used
        throughout the Old Testament. Both senses are probably combined in
        the word here, for it was by making and keeping them holy that the
        Apostles were to be efficaciously set apart by the Father for the
        sacred mission to which Christ had already called them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the common
        opinion is that Christ speaks of the sacrifice of Himself which He
        was about to offer a few hours afterwards. In this view the meaning
        is: and for them do I set Myself apart, do I consecrate Myself as a
        victim, that they may be truly and efficaciously set apart and
        consecrated for the preaching of the Gospel. Thus while the word
        <span class="tei tei-q">“sanctify”</span> has <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in both clauses the same generic meaning
        of setting apart, there is yet a difference. Christ sets Himself
        apart, devotes Himself to death, that they may be consecrated in the
        fulness of grace for the work of the Apostleship. Christ sets Himself
        apart, but the Apostles are evidently to be set apart by the Father;
        that is to say, effectually fitted by the Father for the work to
        which Christ had already called them.</p>

        the faithful cannot, of course, equal the unity of nature in the
        Persons of the Blessed Trinity; but since it is here compared with
        the latter, we are justified in concluding that it is as perfect as
        possible; and hence a unity of intellect through faith, of will
        through charity, and of government through the due subordination of
        the different members. Such a moral miracle as this unity implies,
        must suppose a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        it was very natural that Christ speaking of the union of the faithful

        prayed in verses 20-21 for all the faithful, Christ now continues His
        prayer for the Apostles, as a comparison of this verse with verses 11
        and 12 proves. And this, His last petition for them, is, that they
        may one day be made partakers of that glory which He as God enjoyed

        believe there is not question merely of the glory of Christ's
        humanity, for He seems to pray here that the Apostles may enjoy the
        bliss of heaven, which does not consist in the vision of Christ's
        humanity, but in the vision and enjoyment of the Divinity. If this is
        the correct view, and we think, with A Lap., that it is, then this
        glory was given from all eternity to the Son. The words: <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Because thou hast loved
        me</span></span>, do not, in this view, state the <em class=

        the communication of the eternal glory of the Father to the Son. See

        understood, as St. Aug. understood them, of Christ's humanity, then

        the world is not eternal; while Christ's claim to have been loved by
        the Father before creation, is a claim to personal existence before
        the world began, and indirectly, therefore, a claim to an eternal
        Personality.</p>

        Jesus accompanied by the Apostles now proceeds towards Mount Olivet

        way. As we stated already, we believe that the discourse (xv. 1-xvi.
        33) and the prayer after the Last Supper were not spoken while Christ
        and the Apostles passed along, but at some point of rest either
        outside the Supper-room or along the way. See above on <a href=

        seem to refer only to the time then past, but as Christ then knew
        that He would continue to guard the Apostles from danger during the
        few hours of His life that remained, He meant the words to express
        His care for the Apostles up to the moment of His death, and
        therefore on this occasion at Gethsemani. His present action was,
        accordingly, one fulfilment of what is recorded <span class=

        their souls. That it regarded their bodies, may be fairly concluded
        from His words: <span class="tei tei-q">“let these go their

        that verse 24: <span class="tei tei-q">“Annas (<em class=

        sent,”</span> &amp;c., is added by St. John to guard the reader
        against supposing that what is recorded in verses 15-23 took place at
        the house of Annas. St. Cyril of Alexandria, and a few Greek and

        account of St. John harmonizes at once with the Synoptic Gospels,
        which represent St. Peter's first denial, recorded in verse 17 here,
        as taking place in the court of Caiphas.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many commentators
        of note, such as Patrizzi among Catholics, and Alford among
        Protestants, reconcile St. John's account with that of the Synoptic
        Evangelists in another way. They hold that the events recorded in
        verses 15-23 took place when Jesus was brought before Annas; but as
        Caiphas and Annas occupied an official residence in common, or as
        Annas was, perhaps, the guest of Caiphas, his son-in-law, on this
        night of the Paschal Supper, though it was <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Annas</span></em> who
        examined Christ, as recorded by St. John (verses 10-23), yet it was
        to the court of Caiphas, or the common court attached to the house of
        Annas and Caiphas, that Jesus entered (verse 15); and there, too, St.
        Peter denied His Master for the first time. In any of the above
        opinions, St. John agrees with the Synoptic Evangelists, that the
        place of St. Peter's first denial was the court of Caiphas: but in
        the second opinion, the <span class="tei tei-q">“high priest”</span>
        of verse 19 is Annas, not Caiphas. See Patriz., Liber ii. Adnot.
        clxxvii.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From St. Matthew
        (xxvi. 59) and St. Mark (xiv. 55) we learn that Caiphas was not alone
        on this occasion. The whole Sanhedrim was present; but as the case
        was an important one, this body had to meet again formally after
        day-dawn, to finally decide it. See below on verse <a href=

        convenient to treat of the three denials by Peter (verses 17, 25-27)
        together. Many Rationalist and Protestant commentators have alleged
        that it is impossible to harmonize the different accounts of these
        denials. We hope to show, however, that there is little difficulty in
        harmonizing them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this end we
        would draw attention, with Dean Alford,<a id="noteref_113" name=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a> to the
        following points:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In the first place, we are not bound to require
        accordance ... in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">each
        occasion</span></em> of denial, and independent narrators may have
        fixed on different ones among them.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Secondly, no reader ... will require that the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual words spoken
        by Peter</span></em> should in each case be <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">identically
        reported</span></em>.”</span> In support of this view, Alford refers
        to the remarks of St. Augustine on the words: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Domine, salva nos, perimus”</span> (Matt. viii. 25).
        <span class="tei tei-q">“What matters it,”</span> says St. Aug.,
        referring to the different versions of the words given by the
        Evangelists, <span class="tei tei-q">“whether the disciples, in
        calling on the Lord, really used one or another of those three
        expressions, or some other, not recorded by any of the Evangelists,
        differing from all those that are recorded, but still giving the
        sense, that those who called upon Him were perishing, and called on
        Him to save them.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thirdly, I do not see that we are obliged to limit the
        narrative to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">three sentences</span></em> from Peter's mouth,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and no
        more</span></em>. On <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And those remarks being taken into account, I premise
        that all difficulty is removed, the resulting inference being that

        them all</span></em>.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Similarly,
        Patrizzi:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Considerare etiam juvat, ut ea
        difficultas quam quidam in hac historia esse putant, quod alter
        Evangelista ait Petrum a muliere, alter a viro, hic ab uno, ille a

        clxxviii.) That the reader may apply these principles, and convince
        himself as to their sufficiency, we quote from Dr. Walsh's

        occurred <span class="tei tei-q">“as he went out to the

        follower of Jesus, is different from that given in the other
        Evangelists; but there is no difficulty in supposing that several
        different reasons were given by different persons.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">18. We are not to
        connect this verse with the preceding, as if it indicated that Peter
        was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">standing</span></em> during the first denial. We
        know from St. Matthew (xxvi. 69; Comp. Mark xiv. 54; Luke xxii. 55)
        that he was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        that after the first denial he went out into the passage or vestibule
        (εἰς τὸ προαύλιον). Hence what St. John says here is to be understood
        in reference to a time between the first and second denial.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Greek here is
        somewhat different from the Vulgate. It would be rendered:

        back to their quarters in the castle of Antonia, close to the Temple;
        and hence we find mention here of only the servants of the
        high-priest and the Temple guards.</p>

        while Peter was denying Him in the court, Jesus was being examined by
        the high-priest in a room or hall of the house of Caiphas. See above
        on verse 16. As we have said already, we believe that Caiphas is the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“high-priest”</span> here referred to; so
        that St. John here supplements the account given by the Synoptic
        Evangelists of the preliminary trial, before Caiphas (Matt, xxvi
        59-68; Mark xiv. 55-65; Luke xxii. 54-63). From the other Evangelists
        we learn that many false witnesses now appeared against Jesus; but
        the inquiry regarding His <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">disciples</span></em> and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">doctrine</span></em>
        here recorded by St. John is mentioned by no other Evangelist.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The inquiry
        regarding Christ's disciples was probably intended to find out
        whether He had collected these followers around Him with any
        seditious or unlawful object; and that regarding His doctrine in the
        hope of convicting Him from His own mouth of blasphemy. Later on in
        this trial, as we learn from SS. Matt. and Mark, they did condemn Him
        of blasphemy, and judge Him deserving of death.</p>

        since He, of all teachers (the twice-repeated ἐγώ is in each instance
        emphatic) had taught publicly, and nothing in private <em class=

        "Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Council, was
        accused by false witnesses, convicted of blasphemy, and judged
        deserving of death (Matt. xxvi. 66; Mark xiv. 64). Then he was
        apparently given over to the charge of the servants of the
        high-priest, was spat upon and struck with the closed fist
        (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then when morning
        was come, the Synoptic Evangelists tell us that Jesus was again
        brought before the Sanhedrim, which almost at once decided to hand
        him over to Pilate for punishment. <span class="tei tei-q">“From Luke
        (as also, he might have added, from Matt. xxvii. 1; Mark xv. 1) we
        learn that the night council had been dissolved and that early again,
        in the morning of the last day of our Lord's life, another more
        solemn assembly (rather the same assembly) was summoned, at which all
        the chief-priests and elders and scribes assisted, the subject of
        discussion being urgent and most important. It was, besides, a wise
        Jewish maxim that legal proceedings especially in capital cases
        should be conducted in the light of day, and not in the darkness of
        night”</span> (M'Carthy on St. Matt. xxvii. 1).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was after this
        morning council that Jesus was bound (Matt. xxvii. 2; Mark xv. 1) and
        led before Pilate, as St. John here narrates. At this point, when the
        Lord was brought before Pilate, and His death now seemed certain,
        Judas, touched with remorse, but not with true repentance, brought
        back the blood-money to the priests, and flung it in the temple; then
        in despair went and hanged himself (Matt. xxvii. 3-5).</p>

        accordance with their determination to put Christ to to death, a
        determination of which we are informed by St. Matthew (xxvii. 1),
        they bring Him before the representative of Roman authority to have
        the sentence of death confirmed. See below on verse 29.</p>

        The Roman Governors ordinarily dwelt at Caesarea, on the sea coast;
        but at the more important Jewish festivals they resided in Jerusalem,
        for the purpose of preventing or repressing, if necessary, any
        uprising of the Jewish people against Roman authority (Josephus,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bell.
        Jud.</span></span>, ii. 14, 3). When in Jerusalem, they usually
        occupied the palace of Herod the Great on Mount Sion. A tradition as
        old as the fourth century, however, states that on this occasion
        Pilate was staying in the castle of Antonia, beside the temple on
        Mount Moria.</p>

        night was technically illegal according to Jewish law, so a Roman
        court could not be held till after sunrise. It is likely that the sun
        was not long risen on this morning till the Jews in their eagerness
        appeared with their prisoner at the residence of Pilate. The term
        πρωΐ is, in fact, used in St. Mark xiii. 35, for the fourth watch of
        the night.</p>

        <a href="#XIII_1" class="tei tei-ref">xiii. 1</a> we held that the

        morning was still to be eaten, was not the Paschal lamb. Had there
        been question of the Paschal Supper proper, then such a defilement as
        that contracted by entering the house of a Gentile would not have
        prevented the Jews from partaking of the supper; for it would appear
        from Lev. xv. 5, where there is question of a defilement apparently
        as serious as that which would be contracted from entering the house
        of a Gentile, that such defilement continued only <span class=

        a hindrance to participation in the Paschal Supper, which was eaten

        of the nature of the accusation, either on the preceding night when
        the Roman soldiers were required for Gethsemani, or just now before
        coming out of his house, but he would naturally wish to have it made
        formally. They, having already pronounced Jesus deserving of death,
        and having brought Him to Pilate merely to have the sentence of death
        pronounced and executed without any formality of trial, are indignant
        at the Roman's question, and reply as in verse 30: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered
        him up to thee.”</span> Pilate, wishing to shift from himself
        responsibility for Christ's death, bids the Jews to take Him, and
        judge Him according to their own law. This they declined to do,
        alleging as a reason that the Romans had taken away from the Jews the
        power to punish <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg
        323]</span><a name="Pg323" id="Pg323" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by
        death. This, however, was merely an evasion, for they knew thoroughly
        that Pilate's permission in the present case was sufficient warrant
        for their action, even if they put Jesus to death. But the motive of
        the Jewish leaders was to make the responsibility for His death, in
        the eyes of the Jewish people, rest upon the Romans.</p>

        three distinct charges against Him, which St. Luke records:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“We have found this man perverting our
        nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that He
        is Christ the king”</span> (Luke xxiii. 2). Upon this, Pilate

        was a point which, as questioning <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the sovereignty of Rome, a Roman governor was
        bound to look to. Pilate, therefore, asked Him: <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Art thou the King of the
        Jews?</span></span> The words may mean either, <span class=

        title?”</span> or, <span class="tei tei-q">“Dost thou claim the

        arrest Pilate's attention, whether he had heard it spoken of before
        in connection with the entry into Jerusalem or only now from the
        Jews. And further, he would rightly conclude that the title, when
        thus put forward, would be fitted to call out any fanaticism which
        there might be in a political enthusiast. In each of the four
        Gospels, the first words of Pilate to Jesus are the same:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Art thou the King of the Jews?”</span>
        (Matt. xxvii. 11; Mark xv. 2; Luke xxiii. 3). <span class=

        an embarrassing prisoner, to save himself from a disagreeable
        decision, and to do an unexpected complaisancy to the unfriendly
        Galilean tetrarch, who, as usual, had come to Jerusalem—nominally to
        keep the Passover, really to please his subjects, and to enjoy the

        you; Barabbas, or Jesus, that is called Christ?”</span> (Matt. xxvii.
        17). Barabbas, as we learn from the Synoptic Evangelists, was a

        "tei tei-q">“who was put in prison with some seditious men, who, in
        the sedition, had committed murder.”</span> Pilate hoped, therefore,
        that the release of Jesus rather than of a notorious criminal like
        Barabbas would be called for. But the people, instigated by the
        chief-priests <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg
        327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and

        (λῃιστής), one who appropriates the goods of another by open
        violence, as opposed to the thief (κλέπτης), who takes what is not
        his own, secretly and by fraud.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have followed
        the view held by Patrizzi and the majority of commentators, that
        Pilate on only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">one occasion</span></em>, and after the return
        from Herod, proposed our Lord to the Jews as the prisoner to be
        released. Others, as Father Coleridge and Dr. Walsh, hold that on
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">two</span></em> different occasions, once before
        the journey to Herod, as recorded by St. John, and once after, as
        recorded by the Synoptic Evangelists, Christ was proposed by Pilate
        as the prisoner to be released. But we are not convinced by the
        reasons urged in favour of this view. It is argued—(<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) from
        the fact that in St. John the question of releasing a prisoner is
        first mentioned by Pilate, while in the Synoptic Evangelists the
        question of having a prisoner released to them is first moved by the
        people. But we say, in reply, that there is nothing in the Synoptic
        accounts which forbids us to suppose that Pilate first mentioned the
        matter, as in St. John: <span class="tei tei-q">“You have a custom
        that I should release one unto you at the Pasch;”</span> that then
        they called upon him to observe the custom on that occasion, and that
        he forthwith put before them the choice between Jesus and Barabbas.
        Certainly St. Matt. (xxvii. 17) as well as St. John represents Pilate
        as the first to refer to the matter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Father
        Coleridge argues also from the fact that Pilate, in St. Matt., says
        to the Jews: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whom will you that I release to
        you; Barabbas, or Jesus, that is called Christ?”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That he mentions Barabbas along with our Lord,”</span>
        says Father Coleridge, <span class="tei tei-q">“can only be explained
        by the fact that, as St. John mentions, Barabbas had been already
        called for by the priests and crowd, when Pilate had, for the first
        time, spoken of the custom.”</span> But it seems to us that the
        mention of Barabbas by Pilate is sufficiently explained by the fact
        which St. Matthew himself had just mentioned in the preceding verse,
        that Barabbas was a <span class="tei tei-q">“notorious
        prisoner;”</span> and hence his name was more familiar to Pilate than
        the names of the other prisoners. Moreover his well-known guilt
        encouraged Pilate to hope that if the choice lay between him and
        Jesus, the Jews would surely call for the release of our
        Lord.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg

        released Barabbas, Pilate now thought of another but a cruel means of
        saving the life of Jesus. He had Him scourged, hoping thus to satisfy
        the fury of His enemies (Luke xxiii. 22). Then was fulfilled the
        prophecy of Isaias: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I have given my body to
        the strikers</span></span>, and My cheeks to them that plucked them:
        I have not turned away my face from them that rebuked me, and spat
        upon me”</span> (Isaias 1. 6).</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Had Christ been
        scourged by Jewish authority, according to the Jewish law He should
        not have received more than forty stripes. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“According to the measure of the sin shall the measure
        also of the stripes be: Yet so that they exceed not the number of
        forty: lest thy brother depart shamefully torn before thy
        eyes”</span> (Deut. xxv. 2, 3). By Jewish practice the number of
        stripes was restricted to thirty-nine (See 2 Cor. xi. 24). But as the
        scourging was ordered by Pilate, it was, doubtless, inflicted
        according to the cruel Roman method, in which there was no limit to
        the number of stripes that might be inflicted. The word used by the
        Greek translator of St. Matthew and by St. Mark in reference to this
        scourging is φραγελλώσας, which, like that used by St. John
        (ἐμαστίγωσεν), signifies a scourging with whips or flagella<a id=

        punishment of slaves. It was made of cords or thongs of leather,
        knotted with bones or circles of bronze, or pieces of hard wood, and
        sometimes terminated by hooks in which latter case it was called a
        scorpion. No wonder that Horace (<span class=

        3, 119) speaks of it as <span class="tei tei-q">“horribile

        Mark xv. 15-18. For, while St. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        incident of the cloak as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">preceding</span></em> the sentence of death (see
        verse 16), SS. Matthew and Mark seem to say that they followed
        it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hence, some have
        held that Christ was twice crowned with thorns and clad with a cloak,
        and hailed as King of the Jews: once before the sentence as signified
        here, and once after as indicated by SS. Matthew and Mark.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it seems the
        more probable opinion that these events occurred only once, and
        before the sentence was passed, as St. John records. In this view,
        SS. Matthew and Mark do not record these events and the sentence in
        the order in which they occurred.<a id="noteref_122" name=

        would suggest, in support of this view, that these Evangelists, in
        recording the sentence by which Barabbas recovered his liberty (Matt.
        xxvii. 26; Mark xv. 15), depart from the order of time to record in
        connection with the liberation of Barabbas the condemnation of Jesus.
        Thus the sentence of death, though following the crowning with thorns
        is represented in the two first Gospels as preceding it.</p>

        according to St. John was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        difficulty occurs on a comparison of St. Matthew with St. Mark, for
        the latter also says the cloak was <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purple</span></em>;
        and yet all admit that SS. Matthew and Mark refer to the same
        occasion. In reality, the two Greek words translated purple and

        opposed to the ordinary sense of ἄνωθεν (iii. 31; James i. 17; iii.

        account is to be taken. The meaning is then sufficiently clear. But
        if, as most commentators take for granted, we are to give διὰ τοῦτο

        less than that of Caiphas and the Sanhedrim, who have delivered me to

        against this interpretation, that the word <span class=

        sin is less than that of Caiphas and the Sanhedrim, who with the
        clearest evidences of My Divinity before them have yet condemned Me
        and delivered Me to you. But it is objected to this view also, that
        the words upon which the interpretation hinges, are not found in the
        text.</p>

        thus: since you possess lawful authority, therefore the Sanhedrim is
        more guilty in handing Me over to you than it would be, if you
        possessed not this authority. For, in handing Me over to you, they
        try to brand Me as a malefactor, and they surrender Me to one who has
        the power to put Me to death, even by the cruel death of crucifixion.
        In this view, held by Toletus, the sin of the Sanhedrim is compared,
        not with that of Pilate, but with what their own sin would have been,
        had they merely brought Jesus before some unlawful tribunal.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last
        connection, though, perhaps, not sufficiently obvious, is the most
        natural. The meaning of the whole verse is: You have lawful authority
        indeed, but not independently of God; and since you have lawful
        authority, therefore, My accusers are the more guilty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The words
        <span class="tei tei-q">“he that hath delivered me to thee”</span>

        all those who hold that Christ, in the last year of His mortal life,
        celebrated the Paschal Supper a day before the Jews.<a id=

        hold that St. John here signifies that the Jewish Pasch had not yet
        begun. But the phrase may have, and we believe has, a different
        meaning. We know from St. Mark that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Parasceve”</span> was another name for Friday;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“It was the Parasceve, that is, the day
        before the Sabbath”</span> (Mark xv. 42). Friday naturally enough got
        this name, because it was the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">day of preparation</span></em> for the Jewish
        Sabbath.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the parasceve of the Pasch,”</span> then, we understand
        the Friday of the Paschal week, and we take it that St. John here
        indicates the day of the week, as in the words immediately following
        he indicates the hour of the day. His readers, some of whom were,
        doubtless, acquainted with the Synoptic Gospels, would be already
        aware that this day was the first of the Paschal week, and not the
        eve of the festival. See above on <a href="#XIII_1" class=
        "tei tei-ref">xiii. 1</a>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">About the sixth
        hour.</span></span> A very great difficulty arises from a comparison
        of this account with that of St. Mark. For St. Mark says:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And it was the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">third</span></em>
        hour, and they crucified Him.... And when the sixth hour was come,
        there was darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour”</span>
        (Mark xv. 25, 33).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, while St.
        John represents our Lord as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">condemned</span></em> about the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sixth</span></em>
        hour, St. Mark represents Him as already <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">crucified</span></em>
        at the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">third</span></em> hour. How, it is asked, could
        He be crucified at the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">third</span></em> hour, if He was not condemned
        till the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sixth</span></em>?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many solutions of
        this difficulty have been proposed, but some of them are so
        improbable, that we will not delay upon them. When, for instance, St.
        Augustine says that St. Mark, in stating that the Jews crucified
        Jesus at the third hour, means that at that time they crucified Him
        with their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tongues</span></em> by calling for His
        crucifixion, it is plain from the whole context of St. Mark that such
        a view cannot be admitted; because he evidently speaks of the real
        nailing of Jesus to the cross. Thus he says: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. And
        the inscription of his cause was written over, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The King of the
        Jews</span></span>. And with him they crucify two thieves, the one on
        his right hand, and the other on his left.... And they that passed by
        blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying: <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> ... save thyself, coming down from the
        cross”</span> (Mark xv. 25-30).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, setting aside
        the less probable methods of reconciliation, we must notice four
        which have found favour with commentators.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) Maldonatus and
        many of the older commentators hold that besides the division of the
        Jewish day into twelve hours, there was also another division into
        four periods, corresponding to the four watches of the night.<a id=
        "noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href="#note_124"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a> Thus,
        at the Pasch, which occurred about the time of the vernal equinox,
        these four periods, or <span class="tei tei-q">“hours,”</span> would
        be respectively—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">a</span></span>) from 6 to 9 a.m.; (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) from 9
        a.m. to noon; (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">c</span></span>) from noon to 3 p.m.; and
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">d</span></span>) from 3 to 6 p.m. According to
        Mald., these periods were called respectively, the third, sixth,
        ninth, and twelfth <span class="tei tei-q">“hour.”</span> He
        curiously supposes, however, that sometimes any one of these
        <span class="tei tei-q">“hours”</span> or periods was referred to
        either by the name of the hour with which it began, or by the name of
        that with which it closed. Hence the period between 9 a.m. and noon,
        or, to speak more correctly, a time within that period—about 11.30
        a.m.—is referred to by St. Mark as the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">third</span></em>
        hour; while a time within the same period, but about an hour earlier
        is referred to by St. John as the sixth hour.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This view is now
        generally abandoned, and not without reason. For, in the first place,
        there are no solid grounds for believing that the fourfold division
        of the Jewish day here supposed, ever existed. In the second place,
        even if it had existed, we should require a great deal of proof,
        indeed, before we could believe that the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“hours”</span> were numbered in so strange and confusing
        a fashion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) More probable
        than the preceding is the view of Cornely (Introd., vol. iii., § 73,
        3). He, too, like Mald., holds the above fourfold division of the
        day, but says that the divisions were called respectively, the first,
        third, sixth, and ninth hour. Now, the Synoptic Evangelists, he says,
        follow this fourfold division of the day; and, hence, St. Mark's
        third hour is the time from 9 a.m. to noon. St. John, on the other
        hand, reckons according to the more accurate Jewish method of
        dividing the day into twelve equal parts; and, therefore, his phrase,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“about the sixth hour,”</span> means
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">about
        noon</span></em>. Cornely thinks that the vagueness of the phrase:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">About</span></em> the sixth hour”</span>
        justifies us in supposing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg
        339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        that the time when Pilate passed sentence upon our Lord, according to
        St. John, may have been as early as half-past ten. Thus, condemned
        about half-past ten, Jesus could be led out to Calvary and put upon
        the cross before noon; in other words, while, as St. Mark says, it
        was still the third hour.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though this view
        is more probable than the preceding, we cannot accept it. For it
        supposes, like the preceding, a division of the day into four
        <span class="tei tei-q">“hours,”</span> for which Cornely offers no
        evidence any more than Maldonatus. Moreover, we cannot bring
        ourselves to believe that St. John would refer to a time so early as
        half-past ten as <span class="tei tei-q">“about the sixth
        hour.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) Others think
        that while St. Mark follows the Jewish division of the day, and,
        therefore counts the hours from sunrise, St. John, on the other hand,
        follows the Greek method, and counts them from midnight. Thus, about
        the time of the equinox, St. Mark's <span class="tei tei-q">“third
        hour”</span> would mean about 9 a.m., while St. John's <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“about the sixth hour”</span> would mean about 6 a.m.
        According to this view, our Lord was condemned about 6 a.m., and
        nailed to the cross about 9 a.m.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Against this view,
        it is held by many writers that St. John, like the other Evangelists,
        counts the hours of the day from sunrise, that is to say, according
        to the Jewish method.<a id="noteref_125" name="noteref_125" href=
        "#note_125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">125</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But a still more
        serious difficulty against this view arises from the difficulty of
        finding time for all the events of the morning of the Crucifixion
        between day-dawn and 6 a.m.—the time at which, in this opinion, our
        Lord was condemned by Pilate. <span class="tei tei-q">“Those events
        ... were—(1) the meeting of the Council; (2) the procession to
        Pilate's Court; (3) the various incidents recorded by the four
        Evangelists on the occasion of our Lord's first appearance before
        Pilate's tribunal; (4) the sending of our Lord to Herod; (5) the
        interview between our Lord and Herod; (6) the mocking of our Lord by
        Herod's soldiers; (7) the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg
        340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        return to the Court of Pilate; (8) the scourging; (9) the crowning
        with thorns; (10) the mocking of our Lord by the Roman soldiers; (11)
        the incident of the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ecce Homo,’</span> and
        (12) the final interview, within the Praetorium, between our Lord and
        Pilate, at the close of which Pilate came forth, and, after a final
        effort to obtain the liberation of our Lord, took his place on the
        judgment seat, <span class="tei tei-q">‘and it was now about the
        sixth hour.’</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It would seem, then, that the most satisfactory solution
        of the difficulty is that given by the great majority of modern
        commentators—Catholic as well as Protestant—namely, that an error has
        crept into the text of St. John's Gospel, and that the true reading
        of the passage in question there (xix. 14), is to be obtained by
        substituting <span class="tei tei-q">‘third’</span> for <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘sixth.’</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Manifestly, such a correction of the text removes the
        difficulty we are considering. On the one hand, it leaves abundance
        of time before Pilate's sentence—three or four hours—for the events
        of the earlier part of the morning. On the other hand, it leaves
        quite sufficient time—an interval, it may be supposed, of nearly an
        hour—between the passing of the sentence and the actual crucifixion;
        for St. John's statement, that it was <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘about’</span> the third hour, might surely be understood
        of any time between half-past eight and nine o'clock; and St. Mark's
        words are quite consistent with the supposition that our Lord was
        crucified at any time between nine and ten.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And it is not to be supposed that the emendation of the
        text is suggested merely on <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>
        grounds. For (1) this reading is actually found in one of the five
        Greek MSS. of the New Testament that rank highest in antiquity and
        authority—Codex D. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        this MS dates probably from the 5th or 6th century. Moreover (2) we
        have in its favour the very strong testimony of an ancient writer,
        the author of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Chronicon Paschale</span></span> (circ.
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        reading on the authority of many <span class="tei tei-q">‘accurate
        copies,’</span> and mentions the striking fact that the clause was
        thus read in St. John's original autograph of his Gospel, then
        extant, and, of course, deeply venerated by the faithful in the
        Church at Ephesus.”</span> (See Patrizzi, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
        Evangeliis</span></span>, lib. ii., n. 195.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But, it may be objected, is it not a somewhat forced
        hypothesis to suppose that an interchange of two words so dissimilar
        as τρίτη and ἕκτη,—the Greek words for <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘third’</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">‘sixth’</span>
        respectively—could have occurred by an error of transcription? By no

        id="Pg341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> means. For, in the first
        place, it must be remembered that the usage was almost universal of
        using the numeral characters—which, in Greek consist of letters of
        the alphabet—instead of writing the words in full. Thus the change
        would consist merely in the substitution of one letter for another.
        But, furthermore, it is essential to explain that when the ancient
        MSS. of the Greek Testament were written, it was the usage to employ
        only capital, or, as they are called, uncial letters—thus those MSS.
        themselves are commonly known as uncial. Now, since the character by
        which the numeral 3 was represented was <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">gamma</span></span>, the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">third</span></em>
        letter of the Greek alphabet, its uncial form was Γ. The character by
        which the numeral 6 was represented was the now obsolete <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">digamma</span></span>, at one time the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sixth</span></em> letter of the Greek alphabet:
        its uncial form was Ϝ.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thus then we find that the error which, it is suggested,
        has crept into this verse of the text of St. John consisted merely in
        the interchange of the characters Ϝ and Γ—a mistake so easily made
        that its very facility constitutes a strong antecedent probability in
        favour of the view that it, in fact, occurred.”</span><a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this view,

        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        hour at the season of the Pasch extended from about 8 till 9 a.m.,
        St. Mark's <span class="tei tei-q">“third hour”</span> may refer to a
        time immediately after 8 a.m. This opinion allows abundance of time
        for the events which on that Good Friday morning preceded the
        sentence of death. For, as the sun at the Pasch rose about 6 a.m.,
        day-dawn began about half-past four; and thus we have nearly four
        hours from the assembling of the Sanhedrim, before which Jesus was
        led at dawn, till the sentence was pronounced upon Him by Pilate. In
        this view, our Lord was put upon the cross about 9 a.m.</p>

        <span class="tei tei-q">“and led him forth,”</span> are probably not
        genuine. We learn from the Synoptic Evangelists that Jesus was now
        mocked, stripped of the purple cloak, and clothed with His own
        garments. Then, like Isaac of old (Gen. xxii. 6), bearing the wood on
        which He was to suffer, Jesus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">went forth</span></em> (comp. <a href="#XVIII_1"
        class="tei tei-ref">xviii. 1</a>) to the place where He was
        crucified. By Jewish as well as Roman law the execution should take
        place outside the city; Numb. xv. 35; 3 K. xxi. 13. And Cicero says:
        Quid enim attinuit, cum Mamertini <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more atque instituto
        suo</span></em>, crucem fixissent <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">post
        urbem</span></em> in via Pompeia, &amp;c. (Verr. v. 66). Calvary,
        which is now within the walls of Jerusalem, was then outside them,
        lying to the west of the city. A very old tradition represents Jesus
        as falling three times beneath the cross on His way to Calvary; and
        the three Synoptic Evangelists tell us that Simon of Cyrene<a id=
        "noteref_127" name="noteref_127" href="#note_127"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a>,
        probably a Jew who had come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Pasch, was
        forced to carry the cross. It is disputed whether Simon was made to
        bear the cross alone <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg
        343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> or
        merely to assist Jesus. The latter view is frequently followed in
        paintings, but the former seems more probable. Jesus was now worn and
        weak, and as the Jews were impatient to hurry on to the place of
        punishment; perhaps, too, through a fear that He might otherwise die
        on the way and deprive them of the pleasure of seeing Him writhing on
        the cross, they would be more likely to relieve Him from even helping
        to carry the cross. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nota,”</span> says A
        Lapide, <span class="tei tei-q">“non videri Simonem crucem gestasse
        cum Christo hac ratione, ut Christus priorem crucis partem, Simon
        posteriorem portaret, uti pingunt pictores; sed ipsum solum totam

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Luke alone
        mentions the incident of the women of Jerusalem, who followed Jesus
        bewailing and lamenting for Him (Luke xxii. 27-31). A very ancient
        tradition represents the Blessed Virgin as meeting Jesus in this sad
        procession to Calvary.</p>

        in the Vulgate is not a proper name. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is
        simply the Latin for κρανίον, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">bare skull</span></em>, and used in Vulgate only
        here (Matt.) and in the parallel passages of Mark, Luke, and John
        when describing the crucifixion—nowhere else in the Old or New
        Testament. Golgotha was the Hebrew name of the spot where our Lord
        was crucified. The pure Hebrew form of the word גלגלת (Gulgoleth),
        meaning a skull (from גלל (galal) <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to roll, to be
        round</span></span>), is found in Judges ix. 53. Thence came the
        Chaldaic (rather we should say, Syro-Chaldaic), Gulgalta, abbreviated
        into Golgotha. But why was the place called Golgotha, or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">skull</span></em>?
        Either because criminals were commonly executed on that spot, and
        many skulls were found there bleaching in the sun (St. Jerome and
        most modern Catholic comm.); or the mound was skull-like (St. Cyril
        of Jerusalem alludes to this view, but refutes it); or (according to
        tradition) the skull of the first man, Adam, was buried there (Orig.,
        St. Epiph., and nearly all the fathers) ...: In accordance with this
        opinion (of the fathers), we see so often in paintings and pictures a
        skull placed at the foot of the cross. Although we read constantly in
        sermons of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">hill</span></em> of Calvary, there is little to
        show that there was any hill or mound on the spot named <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Golgotha</span></span>.
        St. Cyril of Jerusalem objects to the derivation of Calvary from the
        mound being skull-shaped, because he says there was <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no hill</span></em>
        there. In the whole history of the Passion no mention is made of the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">mount</span></em> or hill of Calvary.... The
        traditional spot is simply on a high ground, like Holborn in London,
        or Patrick's-hill in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg

        the three inscriptions were in Latin, but written in Syro-Chaldaic,
        Greek, and Latin characters, respectively. This opinion, however, has
        nothing to recommend it. The obvious sense of the verse before us,

        <span class="tei tei-q">“vinegar”</span> was the posca, or thin wine,
        which was the ordinary drink of the Roman soldiers, and that it was
        there on this occasion for their use. But the fact that the sponge
        and hyssop seem to have been at hand, provided apparently for the
        sake of the victims, makes it very probable that the vinegar also was
        provided on their account. We must carefully distinguish this
        occasion from another referred to by SS. Matt. and Mark, prior to the
        crucifixion (Matt. xxvii. 34; Mark xv. 23). These Evangelists refer
        to the present occasion also, but they speak of only one who took the
        sponge, and gave Christ to drink (Matthew xxvii. 48; Mark xv. 36). We
        may reconcile St. John's account with theirs, by saying that he
        simply uses the indefinite plural for the singular; or that he
        ascribes to many what was done by one with their approval. One of
        those present, then, probably a soldier, took a sponge,<a id=

        soaked it in vinegar, and fastened it around the point of a sprig of
        hyssop, and then reached it up to our Lord's <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class=

        Scripture accomplished: <span class="tei tei-q">“And in My thirst
        they gave Me vinegar to drink”</span> (Ps. lxviii. 22). Many think
        that the vinegar was given to hasten death.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hyssop is an
        aromatic plant, which grows upon walls. Its stalks are less than two
        feet long, so that our Lord's mouth seems not to have been raised
        higher above the ground than such a stalk in a man's outstretched arm
        could reach.</p>

        This verse strongly confirms the view we hold (see above on verse 14)
        that St. John means by parasceve, the day before the Sabbath, that is
        to say, Friday; not the day before the Paschal feast. For, in the
        present verse the fact that it was the parasceve is evidently taken

        the bodies buried on the same day in the present case, as the next
        day was to be a Sabbath, and a very special Sabbath, too. And as the
        Sabbath began at sunset, hence the anxiety of the Jews <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to have the bodies removed. The breaking
        of the legs was intended to insure death. With the Romans it was
        usual to let the bodies of the crucified hang till they rotted.</p>

        tradition points to the right side, and it was on his right side,

        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">And immediately there
        came out blood and water.</span></span> It is disputed whether this
        flow of blood and water was natural or miraculous.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) Some hold that
        each flow was miraculous, because in a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dead</span></em> body
        blood does not flow and water is not found in the region of the
        heart.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) Others, on the
        contrary, hold that in each case the flow was quite natural, because
        in a dead body the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">clot</span></em> or red corpuscles become
        separated from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">serum</span></em> or watery substance of the
        blood, and both would naturally flow out when Christ's side was
        pierced. This opinion, however, is improbable, as the best modern
        physiologists say it would require four hours after death to effect
        this separation,<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href=
        "#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a> and no
        such length of time can be admitted between the death of Christ at
        three o'clock and the piercing of his side, for he had to be buried
        before sunset, that is to say, at the latest, about 6 p.m.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) Hence others
        hold that Christ's heart had broken, and that the blood which had
        therefore flowed into the pericardium, or sheath of the heart, had
        become, when extravasated, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">rapidly</span></em> dissolved into its
        constituent elements. This view is held by some writers of great
        authority. See Dr. Stroud's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Treatise on the Physical Cause of the Death of
        Christ</span></span>. Against it, however, we have the opinion of
        physiologists, that the heart never breaks except in those in whom
        the organism has been long diseased; and it is contrary <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to the common opinion that Christ took or
        had a diseased body, or any diseased organ.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) Hence, with
        Corluy, we think the most probable view is, that the blood flowed
        naturally from a body <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">only a short time dead</span></em>, the water
        miraculously. Certainly the fathers generally seem to see in this
        flow of blood and water a mystery, something that was not ordinary or
        natural, and many think that our Evangelist himself, in the next
        verse, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">insists</span></em> upon the truth of what he
        says, as if it were something wholly unnatural and difficult to
        believe. It may, however, be replied to this latter argument that he
        insists upon the truth of the facts, not because anything miraculous
        and difficult to believe had taken place, but because there was
        question of the fulfilment of two important Messianic prophecies.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
        fathers, the flow of blood typified the Sacrament of the Blessed
        Eucharist, that of water, the Sacrament of Baptism. Thus St. Cyril of
        Alex.: <span class="tei tei-q">“Lancea latus ejus perfodiunt, unde
        cruor aqua mistus scaturiit, quod Eulogiae mysticae et baptismatis
        imago quaedam erat atque primitiae.”</span></p>

        St. Jerome (Onom. sacr., 2nd Ed., p. 178) identifies Arimathea with

        fully carried out. If we suppose Joseph to have come soon after the
        Jews (verse 31) to Pilate, the governor, before granting his request,
        would naturally wish to be certain that Jesus was dead, and would
        therefore summon the centurion and make inquiry (Mark xv. 44, 45);
        then Joseph, returning from wherever Pilate was at the time, arrived
        before the body of our Lord had been taken down by the soldiers.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. John's
        narrative regarding the visit of Magdalen to the tomb on Easter
        Sunday morning is very simple, when taken by itself. She came to the
        tomb or, at least, started for it, <span class="tei tei-q">“when it
        was yet dark,”</span> and then ran from the tomb to tell Peter and
        John that the body of Jesus had been removed (xx. 1, 2). But when we
        compare this account with those of the other Evangelists several
        serious difficulties arise. Thus, while St. John says that Magdalen
        <span class="tei tei-q">“cometh early, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">when it was yet
        dark</span></em>, unto the sepulchre;”</span> St. Matthew says that
        she and the other Mary came to see the sepulchre <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">end of the Sabbath</span></em> (according to the
        Vulgate: <span class="tei tei-q">‘<em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Vespere</span></em>
        Sabbati’</span>), when it began to dawn towards the first day of the
        week”</span> (Matt. xxviii. 1). And St. Mark creates still further
        difficulty when he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“And when the
        Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalen, and Mary (the mother) of James, and
        Salome bought (not brought; Vulg. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> emerunt) sweet spices, that coming they might
        anoint Jesus. And very early in the morning, the first day of the
        week, they come to the sepulchre, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the sun being now
        risen</span></em>”</span> (Mark xvi. 1-2). Thus, while St. Matt.
        represents Magdalen as coming to the sepulchre in the end of the
        Sabbath, or as the still more difficult text of the Vulgate has it:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Vespere Sabbati,”</span> St. Mark represents
        her as coming on Sunday morning, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">when the sun was
        risen</span></em>; and St. John, as coming on the Sunday morning
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">when it was
        yet dark</span></em>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, while St.
        John does not mention the appearance of any angel on the occasion of
        Magdalen's first visit to the tomb (John xx. 1), St. Mark says that
        when the women entered the tomb <span class="tei tei-q">“they saw a
        young man <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sitting</span></em> on the right side clothed
        with a white robe”</span> (Mark xvi. 5); and St. Luke, that after the
        women entered the tomb, and found not the body of the Lord
        <span class="tei tei-q">“behold <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">two</span></em> men <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">stood</span></em> by
        them in shining apparel”</span> (Luke xxiv. 4).<a id="noteref_132"
        name="noteref_132" href="#note_132"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Various theories
        have been advanced to reconcile these different accounts. Maldonatus
        (on Matt. xxviii. 3) undertakes, with his usual great ability, but,
        we think, without success, to reconcile them in the hypothesis, not
        merely that there was only one company of women, but also that Mary
        Magdalen visited the tomb but once on the morning of the
        resurrection. Others, while admitting that Magdalen came twice to the
        tomb that morning, as, indeed, seems to follow naturally from St.
        John's account (xx. 2-11), hold that there was only one company of
        women, and that all the Evangelists speak of the same company. Others
        again hold that not only did Magdalen come twice to the tomb, but
        that at least two different companies of women visited the tomb that
        morning, and that some Evangelists refer to the visit of one company,
        others to the visit of the other company. Thus Patrizzi (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
        Evang.</span></span>, Diss. liii. 5, 6, 7) supposes SS. Matt. and
        Mark to refer to the visit of one company, SS. Luke and John to the
        visit of a different company. On the other hand Dr. Walsh
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Harmony of
        the Gosp. Narr.</span></span>), Cornely (Introd. III., <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Synops.
        Chron.</span></span>, p. 301), <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Harm. of the
        Gosp.</span></span>), suppose St. Luke to refer to the visit of one
        company, the other three Evangelists to that of a different
        company.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following
        seems to us the most satisfactory method of reconciling all the
        accounts. Very early on Sunday morning, <span class="tei tei-q">“when
        it was yet dark”</span> (John xx. 1), Mary Magdalen, accompanied,
        perhaps from the start, by Mary of Cleophas, set out from Bethany,
        where we suppose her to have spent the preceding day and night in the
        house of her brother Lazarus. To this same departure from Bethany and
        to the same two women (compare Matt. xxviii. 1 with xxvii. 56) St.
        Matt. refers: <span class="tei tei-q">“And in the end of the Sabbath,
        when it began to dawn towards the first day of the week, came Mary
        Magdalen and the other Mary to see the sepulchre”</span> (Matt.
        xxviii. 1).<a id="noteref_133" name="noteref_133" href=
        "#note_133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a>
        Proceeding on their way they were joined by Salome and probably by
        others, and arrived at the tomb, <span class="tei tei-q">“the sun
        being now risen”</span> (Mark xvi. 2). The journey from Bethany was
        nearly three miles, for Bethany was nearly two miles east of
        Jerusalem (John xi. 18), and Calvary was another mile westward from
        the eastern part of the city. We may well suppose, then, that an hour
        and a half—the length of morning twilight at Jerusalem about the
        season of the Pasch (Patriz. Diss. liii. 2)—was spent on the journey,
        especially if, as we may suppose, there were delays on the way while
        the party was being joined by other women; and hence, though the
        start from Bethany took place while it was still dark (John xx. 1),
        they did not arrive at the tomb till the sun had risen (Mark xvi.
        2).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While these women
        were on their way, Christ rose and quitted the sealed tomb, and after
        His resurrection an angel rolled away the stone and sat <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> upon it, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the sight of the
        guards</span></em> (Matt. xxviii. 2-4). The women on arriving saw the
        stone already rolled away (Mark xvi. 4; John xx. 1), and Magdalen
        probably ran and looked into the tomb. Not seeing the body of Jesus,
        she concluded it had been removed, and ran to say so to the disciples
        (John xx. 2).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her companions
        remained at the tomb and entered it, and the angel mentioned by St.
        Matt. (xxviii. 5) and St. Mark (xvi. 5) appeared to them. The women
        then left the tomb in fear and astonishment and great joy, and ran to
        tell the disciples, but through fear told no one <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on the
        way</span></em> (Mark xvi. 8), though their hearts were full of the
        wonderful and joyous event.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon after their
        departure from the tomb, Peter and John arrived coming to see if what
        Magdalen announced was true. Then Peter and John departed, and
        Magdalen who had followed them to the tomb, remained behind them, and
        saw the two angels <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sitting</span></em> (John xx. 12). Then Jesus
        appeared to her (John xx. 14-17), before he had appeared to anyone
        else, as we learn from St. Mark: <span class="tei tei-q">“But He
        rising early the first day of the week appeared first to Mary
        Magdalen out of whom he had cast seven devils”</span> (xvi. 9).<a id=
        "noteref_134" name="noteref_134" href="#note_134"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">134</span></span></a>
        Meantime the women, Magdalen's companions, were on their way to the
        disciples, and now Jesus appeared to them (Matt. xxviii. 9),
        immediately after He had appeared to Magdalen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now we have
        reconciled the accounts of SS. Matthew, Mark, and John regarding
        Magdalen and her companions. It remains to speak of St. Luke's
        account.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We believe that
        St. Luke speaks of a different company of women from that referred to
        by the other Evangelists. There is nothing improbable in supposing
        that more than one company of women came to the tomb on Sunday
        morning. As they had not been able to visit it on the Sabbath, a
        visit of several companies on Sunday morning is just what might be
        expected. But we are not obliged to depend merely on <span lang="la"
        class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> reasoning. For St. Luke's
        company prepared their spices on Friday evening before the Sabbath:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and returning they prepared spices and
        ointments: and on the Sabbath-day they rested according to the
        commandment”</span> (Luke xxiii. 56); the other company, after the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a name="Pg360"
        id="Pg360" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Sabbath, when the first day of
        the Jewish week had begun: <span class="tei tei-q">“and when the
        Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalen and Mary <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        mother</span></em> of James and Salome bought sweet spices, that
        coming they might anoint Jesus.”</span> (Mark xvi. 1). Moreover, the
        women of whom St. Luke speaks seem to have come to the tomb earlier
        than any other company, for they came ὄρθρου βαθέος (literally, at
        the first dawn, Luke xxiv. 1): and we are not to conclude that they
        merely set out for the tomb at this early hour, for they seem to have
        arrived at the tomb before the sun was risen: see Luke xxiv. 22:
        ὄρθριαι ἐπὶ τό μνημεῖον.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the natural
        inference from Luke xxiv. 9-12, 22-24 is that the women he mentions
        had returned from the tomb and announced Christ's resurrection before
        Peter and John went to the tomb. We are disposed to hold with
        Patrizzi (Lib. iii., Diss. liii. 4) that St. Luke xxiv. 10 is a
        summary account of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">all</span></em> the announcements made by the
        various women to the different followers of Christ that morning; and
        hence all the women there referred to need not be supposed to have
        gone to the disciples before Peter and John went to the tomb. But we
        think that Luke xxiv. 22-24, compared with Luke xxiv. 12, proves that
        others besides Magdalen had come to the disciples from the tomb
        before Peter and John went thither. <span class="tei tei-q">“Yea, and
        certain women also of our company affrighted us, who before it was
        light (ὄρθριαι) were at the sepulchre. And not finding his body,
        came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who say that
        he is alive. And some of our people went to the sepulchre: and found
        it so as the women had said, but him they found not”</span> (Luke
        xxiv. 22-24).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hence we hold that
        St. Luke's company of women started for the tomb at early dawn, after
        Magdalen had set out from Bethany, but as they probably spent the
        night in Jerusalem, they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">arrived before</span></em> her, saw the two
        angels <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">standing</span></em> (Luke xxiv. 4), and then
        went to announce Christ's resurrection to the disciples. Not long
        after the departure of this company, Magdalen and her companions
        arrived at the tomb, and Magdalen <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">running</span></em>
        from the tomb (John xx. 2) arrived at the house where Peter and John
        were staying, about the same time as St. Luke's company, or perhaps a
        little later. Her announcement that the Lord's body had been removed,
        confirming to some extent the announcement of St. Luke's company that
        He had risen, Peter and John now ran to the <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class=

        already arranged above.</p>

        discovered what had been unnoticed by St. John. The presence of the
        linen swathes, and the napkin folded and laid apart, are doubtless
        mentioned as proof that Christ was truly risen. Had His body been
        simply taken away to some other tomb, those taking it, whether
        friends or enemies, would not have gone to the useless trouble of
        removing the spice-covered bandages and the napkin. And, certainly,
        if it had been hurriedly stolen, such nice care would not have been
        taken to fold the napkin and place it apart. So, substantially, St.
        Chrysostom on this verse.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        "font-style: italic">fifth</span></em> apparition of Jesus on that
        day, mentioned in the Gospels. He passed through the closed doors in
        virtue of the property of subtility which His glorified body
        possessed, and saluted the Apostles <span class="tei tei-q">“and
        those who were with them”</span> (Luke xxiv. 33-36) with the usual
        Jewish salutation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From a comparison
        of St. Luke (xxiv. 33-36), we know that the disciples who had
        returned from Emmaus were present when our Lord appeared on the
        occasion here mentioned by St. John. Now, Emmaus was sixty stadia
        (about seven English miles) from Jerusalem (Luke xxiv. 13), and the
        two disciples did not reach Emmaus till it was <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“towards evening,”</span> and the day was <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“far spent”</span> (Luke xxiv. 29). Hence though they
        tarried only a short time in Emmaus (Luke xxiv. 33), they can hardly
        have returned much before dark. Indeed it may have been after dark,
        and in that case the words <span class="tei tei-q">“when it was late
        that same day”</span> would prove that our Evangelist speaks here,
        not according to the Jewish method of counting the day from evening
        to evening, but according to the Greek method of counting, as we do,
        from midnight to midnight.</p>

        that Christ made it clear that this power was given only to the

        the case mentioned in Numb. xi. 26, when the spirit of prophecy was
        given to Eldad and Medad, though they were absent. Others, as
        Toletus, and A Lap., hold that it was not, as Thomas was now

        the Socinians and Paul of Heidelberg did, that these words are simply
        an exclamation, meaning: O Jehovah! For, besides the fact that Christ
        is addressed, the Jews were not in the habit of using any such
        exclamation. The second council of Constant., cap. 12, condemned

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The authenticity
        of this last chapter of our Gospel has been questioned (see <a href=
        "#Intro_V" class="tei tei-ref">Introd. v</a>.), and it has been
        contended that the chapter was not written by St. John, but by some
        disciple or disciples of his after his death. Even among those who
        admit its authenticity, some have held that it was not written at the
        same time as the rest of the Gospel, but at a later period, and added
        on as an appendix.<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href=
        "#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">138</span></span></a> Both
        those who deny the authenticity of the chapter, and those who hold it
        to be an authentic <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">appendix, written at a later date</span></span>,
        argue from the last two verses of chapter xx., which, they say, prove
        that St. John intended to conclude at that point. In addition to
        this, those who deny the authenticity, contend that the style of this
        chapter is so different from that of the rest of the Gospel as to
        compel the belief that both cannot possibly be the work of the same
        hand.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may begin by
        remarking that no Catholic is free to doubt the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">inspiration</span></em> of the chapter, so that
        whoever wrote it must <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page373">[pg
        373]</span><a name="Pg373" id="Pg373" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        have been inspired. This follows from the decree of Trent, which
        defined the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">entire books</span></em> of the Vulgate with all
        their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">parts</span></em> (and this is certainly a part,
        not merely a <span class="tei tei-q">“particula”</span> of this
        Gospel) to be canonical Scripture. See above on iv. <a href="#IV_3"
        class="tei tei-ref">3</a>, <a href="#IV_4" class=
        "tei tei-ref">4</a>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hence, the only
        questions remaining are: (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">a</span></span>) whether St. John or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some other inspired
        writer</span></em> wrote the chapter; and (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) in
        case St. John wrote it, whether he wrote it at the same time as the
        rest of the Gospel, or later, and as an appendix.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With Catholic
        commentators generally, we hold that the chapter was written by St.
        John and at the same time as the rest of the Gospel. For, since it is
        read in all the MSS., and quoted by all the fathers, the natural
        inference is that it stood in the Gospel from the beginning. Against
        this unanimous testimony of tradition, the arguments for any other
        view have no weight. For, as to the argument drawn from the last two
        verses of chapter xx., we have already, with Mald., Tol., and
        Cornely, given the most probable explanation of those verses, from
        which it appears that they were not intended as a conclusion of the
        whole Gospel, but only of that portion of it which deals with the
        proofs of His Divinity afforded by Christ to the Apostles during His
        risen life.<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href=
        "#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to the argument
        from the difference of style, we confidently deny that any such
        difference exists. Kuinoel, no mean judge on such a point, and
        certainly not a prejudiced witness, says: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Omnino probari nequit, scribendi genus, in hoc capite,
        si clausulam<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href=
        "#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a> ejus
        exceperis, diversum esse a scribendi genere, quod in reliquo
        Evangelio deprehenditur.”</span></p>

        might not look upon the draught as a mere accident. Why they so

        Perhaps the minds of some of them reverted to another occasion, in
        many respects similar to this (Luke v. 4-10), when, after a night of
        fruitless toil, their Master, then with them in His mortal flesh,
        blessed their labours with a miraculous draught of fish in the

        his Master, and foresaw that his garments should necessarily be wet,
        he probably thought it decorous to have some other garment on him
        besides the tight-fitting inner tunic. We suppose therefore that he
        was already clothed in the inner tunic. He girded himself in order
        that the garment might not impede him when swimming. The Greek word,
        which, in our Version, is rendered <span class=

        symbolize the success which was to attend the labours of the Apostles
        in drawing men into the Church, we may note how fitting it was that
        Peter led the way in going to fish (verse 3), and landed the net, and
        brought the fish to his Master on this occasion. For it was he who
        first preached to the Jews on the day of Pentecost, converting about
        three thousand (Acts ii. 14-41), and he, too, who opened the Church

        Me more than thou lovest these companions of thine? For Peter knew
        and believed Jesus to be God (Matt. xvi. 16), had declared before now
        his readiness to die with Him (Luke xxii. 33), and on this very
        morning had proved the intensity of his love for his Master by
        leaping from the boat and quitting the Apostles to come to Him.
        Surely, then, it is wholly improbable that Christ merely meant to ask
        if Peter loved Him more than he loved his fellow-Apostles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The meaning, then,
        plainly is: lovest thou Me more than these love Me? Peter replies,
        humbly avoiding any comparison between his own love and that of his
        companions, and appealing to Jesus, whom he knew to be the Searcher
        of Hearts, in confirmation of the love that he avows: <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Yea, Lord, thou knowest
        that I love thee</span></span>. It is worthy of note that the word
        which Peter uses to express his love, is not that which Christ had
        just used in His question. Christ had asked: Lovest thou (ἀγαπᾷς) Me?
        Peter replies: Yea, Lord, Thou knowest that I love (φιλῶ) Thee. Many
        commentators think the distinction is not to be pressed, but we
        cannot believe that Peter changed the word without a reason,
        especially as he does so again in his second reply (verse 16), and
        Christ, in His third question, adopts the word that Peter insists
        upon using. Whatever the distinction be, it is lost in our English
        version; but the reader will see that an effort is made to preserve
        it in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg
        380]</span><a name="Pg380" id="Pg380" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Vulgate, which in each case renders ἀγαπάω, by <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“diligo,”</span> and φιλέω by <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“amo.”</span> We think that Trench properly appreciates
        the difference between the two words. <span class="tei tei-q">“On
        occasion,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“of that threefold
        Lovest thou Me,”</span> which the risen Lord addresses to Peter, He
        asks him first, ἀγαπᾷ με. At that moment, when all the pulses in the
        heart of the now penitent Apostle are beating with an earnest
        affection towards his Lord, this word on that Lord's lips sounds too
        cold; not sufficiently expressing the warmth of his personal
        affection toward Him. Besides the question itself, which grieves and
        hurts Peter (verse 17), there is an additional pang in the form which
        the question takes, sounding as though it were intended to put him at
        a comparative distance from his Lord, and to keep him there; or at
        least as not permitting him to approach so near to Him as he fain
        would. He, therefore, in his answer substitutes for it the word of a
        more <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">personal</span></em> love, φιλῶ σε (verse 15).
        When Christ repeats the question in the same words as at the first,
        Peter in his reply again substitutes his φιλῶ for the ἀγαπᾷς of his
        Lord (verse 16). And now at length he has conquered; for when for the
        third time his Master puts the question to him, He does it with the
        word which Peter feels will alone express all that is in his heart,
        and instead of the twice-repeated ἀγαπαᾷς, His word is φιλεῖς, now
        (verse 17). (Trench, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        question our Lord drops the comparison between Peter's love and that
        of the other Apostles, and, according to the Greek text, uses
        different words in giving Peter his commission. Before, it was:
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        others read πρόβατά; and while the Vulg. (agnos) favours the former,
        the Vetus Itala (oves) supports the latter. It is difficult, then, to
        decide between the two readings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether Christ
        intended to signify one portion of His Church by the lambs, the
        remaining portion by the sheep, or merely used two different terms to
        indicate, in each case, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        time, Jesus puts the question, but now changing His word to the
        stronger word of Peter's choice. This threefold repetition of the
        question, provoking the threefold confession of Peter's love, was
        probably intended, not only to make amends for Peter's threefold
        denial, but also to indicate the solemn importance of the trust that
        was now committed to him. Peter was grieved at the repetition of the
        question, because it seemed as if his Lord suspected the sincerity of
        his love, or, perhaps, he feared that the repeated questioning
        foreboded another fall.</p>

        of the former we have here not only B and C but also A. On the other
        hand, the Vulgate in this verse (oves) supports the latter. The
        diminutive, as a term of endearment, would not be out of place in
        this verse or the preceding.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Vatican
        Council has interpreted this passage, verses 15-17, of the bestowal
        of the primacy on Peter—a primacy not merely of honour, but also of
        jurisdiction—so that no Catholic is free to interpret the passage in
        any sense other than this. <span class="tei tei-q">“Docemus itaque et

        interpreted in any other sense. For Peter alone is addressed, and his
        love for his master singled out for comparison with that of his
        companions, to show that to him individually, and not to them with
        him, the commission here given was entrusted.</p>

        commission was the Vatican Council tells us in the passage already

        Apostle a martyr's death by crucifixion, we cannot say with

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">23. Our Evangelist
        tells us here what was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></em> the meaning of the Lord's words;
        what their meaning was, he does not say. He merely wished to show
        that the words afforded no ground for the belief which prevailed
        among the faithful, and which his own very advanced age at the time
        when this Gospel was written tended to confirm, that he was not to
        die at all, or at least not until the day of judgment. Those who deny
        the authenticity of this last chapter appeal triumphantly to this
        verse. It was written, they say, after St. John died, when it become
        necessary to explain away the meaning that had been put upon our
        Lord's words. But, from what we have said already, the reader will
        have seen that there is not the slightest reason why this verse may
        not have been written by St. John himself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is a
        difference of opinion as to what our Lord meant by the words:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“If I will have him to remain till I come,
        what is it to thee?”</span> Some have taken the meaning to be: If I
        will have him to remain till I come for him in a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural</span></em>
        death, what is it to thee? But this is not probable; Christ comes for
        the martyr just as much as for him who dies a natural death.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others thus: If I
        will have him to remain till My coming at the destruction of
        Jerusalem, what is it to thee?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is most
        likely that Christ's coming when spoken of absolutely, as here,
        refers to His coming at the day of judgment. Hence the most probable
        view seems to be: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">If I were</span></em> to will him to remain
        living even till the day of judgment, what were that to thee? Thus
        our Lord makes a purely hypothetical case, and conveys no information
        to Peter, thereby reproving still more his curiosity.</p><a name=

        authenticity of these verses has been questioned more than that of
        the rest of the chapter, both because it is not in St. John's manner
        to speak of himself in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg
        386]</span><a name="Pg386" id="Pg386" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        plural number (as here in verse 24: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">we</span></em> know”</span>), and because of the
        hyperbole in verse 25. For these reasons, some Catholic writers have
        denied their authenticity, though no Catholic, as far as we are
        aware, has denied their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">inspiration</span></em>. Those Catholics who
        deny their authenticity, hold that they were probably written by the
        bishops of Asia Minor, at whose request St. John wrote the Gospel.
        See <a href="#Intro_III" class="tei tei-ref">Introd. iii.</a>, note.
        This view is not without some probability. Still, we prefer the
        common opinion of Catholic commentators, that the verses were written
        by St. John himself; for without them the conclusion of the Gospel
        would be extremely abrupt.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to the reasons
        for the opposite view, though we admit that St. John does not usually
        employ the first person plural, still it is not unnatural that in
        closing his Gospel he should wish to confirm his own testimony by an
        appeal to the consenting voice of his contemporaries. Besides, he
        does use the same form of expression in i. 14: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And we saw his glory.”</span> See also 1 Ep. i. 3. As to
        the argument drawn from the alleged extravagance of the hyperbole in
        verse 25, it has no weight. For, there is no reason why St. John may
        not have used this striking hyperbole to signify the inexhaustible
        treasury of instruction contained in our Divine Lord's life and
        works, and to suggest the deep truth that a full account
        (<span class="tei tei-q">“every one”</span>) of Christ's human life
        would be practically infinite. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hunc loquendi
        modum,”</span> says St. Aug. on this passage, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Graeco nomine hyperbolem vocant: qui modus, sicut hoc
        loco, ita in nonnullis aliis divinis Literis invenitur ... et multa

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">There is a clear and important
          difference between the two words for asking used in this verse.
          ᾽Ερωτάω always in classical, and generally in Hellenistic Greek,
          means to interrogate, to question. In Hellenistic Greek it
          sometimes means to request, to petition, as in verse 26 below; but
          even then there is a distinction which is carefully observed
          throughout the New Testament between it and αἰτέω. ᾽Ερωτάω is used
          of the request of an equal, or at least of a familiar friend, αἰτέω
          of the supplication of an inferior. Hence Christ never once uses
          the latter word in reference to His own asking of the Father.</dd>

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">Whether St. John numbers the hours of
          the day according to the Jewish or modern method it is extremely
          difficult to decide from his Gospel. In only four passages (i. 39;
          iv. 6; iv. 52; and xix. 14) does he refer to distinct hours of the
          day, and to these passages the patrons of both opinions appeal. In
          John iv. 6 we read that it was <span class="tei tei-q">“about the
          sixth hour”</span> when Jesus met the Samaritan woman at the well,
          and if we are right in holding that it was then the month of
          December (see above on iv. 35), this would go to show that our
          Evangelist numbers according to the Jewish method. For at 6 a.m. or
          6 p.m. it would be dark, and it is wholly improbable that Jesus in
          the darkness would have held conversation alone with the
          woman.</dd>

          does not say that the women were addressed by the angel while he

          in that position. That he was seen by the guards, one of whom may
          have been afterwards converted and have told this incident, is
          plain from St. Matt.: but we are free to suppose that when the
          angel addressed the women (Matt. xxviii. 5), he may have been
          already within the sepulchre, as in St. Mark.</dd>

          the fact that St. Matt., according to the Vulgate Version,
          represents these women as coming to the tomb on the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">evening</span></em>
          of the Sabbath (Vespere sabbati), disappears, if we admit that the
          Vulgate rendering of the Greek phrase, ὀψὲ δὲ σαββάτων is
          incorrect, or, at least, misleading, and should rather be post
          sabbatum, as the phrase is explained by Mald., Cornely (iii. p.
          301, note S), Kuin., Bloomf., and the majority of commentators.
          Certainly we are convinced that Magdalen did not visit the tomb on
          Saturday evening; for had she done so, she must have learned that
          the tomb was guarded and the stone that closed it sealed, and she
          and her companions would not come as they did on Sunday morning,
          saying to one another: <span class="tei tei-q">“Who shall roll away
          the stone for us?”</span> Had she been at the tomb on Saturday
          evening, she could not have hoped to be allowed to roll away the
          stone, which was sealed and guarded; or, if she hoped for this
          permission from the soldiers, then there would have been no room
          for the difficulty as to who should roll away the stone, as the
          soldiers, if they permitted its removal, might be counted upon to
          remove it for women.</dd>

          Blessed Virgin, and hold that as he appeared in order to confirm

              the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</span></h2>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=
              "http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class=
              "tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
              and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
              including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

              originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of
              electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
              U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
              necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
              edition.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
